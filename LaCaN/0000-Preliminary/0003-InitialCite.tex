			\quote{Dedicated to the city of Barcelona,
				
				A city that has captured my heart and soul with its vibrant culture, breathtaking architecture, and warm people. Barcelona has been the fertile ground in which my ideas have taken root and blossomed during my doctoral journey, as the world grapples with crises and chaos. I am deeply grateful for the opportunities and experiences this magnificent city has provided me.
				
				In homage to Barcelona, I have chosen to adorn this thesis with a cover design that merges Gaudí's trencadís technique and epithelial domes, symbolizing not only my love for this city but also my fascination with the intricacies of nature and the wonders of biological systems.
				
				Moltes Gràcies, Barcelona.}

In this case, it comes from nonconformity, the courage to turn your back on the old formulas, the courage to \textbf{invent the future}. It took the mad people of yesterday for us to be able to act with extreme clarity today. I want to be one of those people.''}

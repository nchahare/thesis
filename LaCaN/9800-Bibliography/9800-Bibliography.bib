  abstract = {In 1917, the publication of On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson challenged both mathematicians and naturalists to think about biological shapes and diversity as more than a confusion of chaotic forms generated at random, but rather as geometric shapes that could be described by principles of physics and mathematics. Thompson's work was based on the ideas of Galileo and Goethe on morphology and of Russell on functionalism, but he was first to postulate that physical forces and internal growth parameters regulate biological forms and could be revealed via geometric transformations in morphological space. Such precise mathematical structure suggested a unifying generative process, as reflected in the title of the book. To Thompson it was growth that could explain the generation of any particular biological form, and changes in ontogeny, rather than natural selection, could then explain the diversity of biological shapes. Whereas adaptationism, widely accepted in evolutionary biology, gives primacy to extrinsic factors in producing morphological variation, Thompson's `laws of growth' provide intrinsic directives and constraints for the generation of individual shapes, helping to explain the `profusion of forms, colours, and other modifications' observed in the living world.},

  abstract = {Morphogenesis in living tissues is the paramount example of a time- and space-dependent orchestration of living matter where shape and order emerge from undifferentiated initial conditions. The genes encode the protein expression that eventually drives the emergence of the phenotype, while energy supply and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms are necessary to such a process. The overall control of the system likely exploits the laws of chemistry and physics through robust and universal processes. Even if the identification of the communication mechanisms is a question of fundamental nature, a long-standing investigation settled in the realm of chemical factors only (also known as morphogens) faces a number of apparently unsolvable questions. In this paper, we investigate at what extent mechanical forces, alone or through their biological feedbacks, can direct some basic aspects of morphogenesis in development biology. In this branch of mechano-biology, we discuss the typical rheological regimes of soft living matter and the related forces, providing a survey on how local mechanical feedbacks can control global size or even gene expression. We finally highlight the pivotal role of nonlinear mechanics to explain the emergence of complex shapes in living matter.},

  abstract = {One of the most remarkable differences between classical engineering materials and living matter is the ability of the latter to grow and remodel in response to diverse stimuli. The mechanical behaviour of living matter is governed not only by an elastic or viscoelastic response to loading on short time scales up to several minutes, but also by often crucial growth and remodelling responses on time scales from hours to months. Phenomena of growth and remodelling play important roles, for example during morphogenesis in early life as well as in homeostasis and pathogenesis in adult tissues, which often adapt to changes in their chemo-mechanical environment as a result of ageing, diseases, injury or surgical intervention. Mechano-regulated growth and remodelling are observed in various soft tissues, ranging from tendons and arteries to the eye and brain, but also in bone, lower organisms and plants. Understanding and predicting growth and remodelling of living systems is one of the most important challenges in biomechanics and mechanobiology. This article reviews the current state of growth and remodelling as it applies primarily to soft tissues, and provides a perspective on critical challenges and future directions.},

Here, we investigate the function of LSR in intestine biology. By using multiple conditional deletion mouse models and ex vivo cultured organoids, we find that LSR elimination in intestinal stem cells results in disappearance of Paneth cell without affecting the differentiation of other cell lineages. Mechanistic studies reveal that LSR deficiency increase abundance and nuclear localization of YAP by modulating its phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. Intestinal LSR-deficient mice are susceptible to development of necrotizing enterocolitis. In addition, LSR can sense and interpret fatty acid signals derived from dietary lipids and transduce into inactivation of YAP. Thus, this study identifies LSR as an upstream negative regulator of YAP activity and part of the mechanism mediating connection between fat diet and YAP signaling in intestine.},

Here we show that the rate of force application (loading rate) drives mechanosensing, as predicted by a molecular clutch model. By applying dynamic force regimes to cells through substrate stretching, optical tweezers, and atomic force microscopy, we find that increasing loading rates trigger talin-dependent mechanosensing, leading to adhesion growth and reinforcement, and YAP nuclear localization. However, above a given threshold the actin cytoskeleton softens, decreasing loading rates and preventing reinforcement. By stretching rat lungs in vivo, we show that a similar phenomenon may occur. Our results show that cell sensing of external forces and of passive mechanical parameters (like tissue stiffness) can be understood through the same mechanisms, driven by the properties under force of the mechanosensing molecules involved.},

Little is known about the emergent properties of such materials. Empirical observations have shown contraction waves propagation in various epithelia, yet the governing mechanism, as well as its physiological function, is still unclear. Here we propose an experiment-inspired model for such dynamic epithelia. We show how the widespread cellular response of contraction-under-tension is sufficient to give rise to propagating contraction pulses, by mapping numerically and theoretically the consequences of such a cellular response. The model explains observed phenomena but also predicts enhanced rip-resistance as an emergent property of such cellular sheets. Unlike healing post-rupture, these sheets avoid it by actively re-distributing external stresses across their surface. The mechanism is relevant to a broad class of tissues, especially such under challenging mechanical conditions, and may inspire engineering of synthetic materials.},

In an effort to bridge these gaps, this paper studies the equivalence of proteins and origami. Research on proteins and origami provides strong evidence to support the use of origami folding principles and mechanical models to explain aspects of proteins formation and function. Although not identical, the equivalence of origami and proteins emerges in: (i) the folding processes, (ii) the shape and structure of proteins and origami models, and (iii) the intrinsic mechanical properties of the folded structures/models, which allows them to synchronically fold/unfold and effectively distribute forces to the whole structure. As a result, origami can contribute to the understanding of various key protein-related mechanisms and support the design of de novo proteins and nanomaterials.},

Here, we first review the role of hydrostatic pressure in tube formation during animal development and discuss mathematical models of lumen formation. We then illustrate specific roles of the notochord as a hydrostatic scaffold in anterior-posterior axis development in chordates. Finally, we cover some examples of how fluid flows influence morphogenetic processes in other developmental contexts. Understanding how fluid forces act during development will be key for uncovering the self-organizing principles that control morphogenesis.},

However, within a monolayer, cells can be contractile or extensile based on the direction of pushing or pulling forces exerted by their neighbours or on the substrate. It has been shown that a monolayer of fibroblasts behaves as a contractile system while epithelial or neural progentior monolayers behave as an extensile system. Through a combination of cell culture experiments and in silico modelling, we reveal the mechanism behind this switch in extensile to contractile as the weakening of intercellular contacts. This switch promotes the build-up of tension at the cell\textendash substrate interface through an increase in actin stress fibres and traction forces. This is accompanied by mechanotransductive changes in vinculin and YAP activation. We further show that contractile and extensile differences in cell activity sort cells in mixtures, uncovering a generic mechanism for pattern formation during cell competition, and morphogenesis.},

The resulting contractility related changes at the level of each single cell impact tissue architecture by triggering changes in cell shape, cell movement and remodelling of the surrounding environment. These out of equilibrium processes occur through the consumption of energy, allowing biological systems to be described by active matter physics. `Active nematics' a subclass of active matter encompasses cytoskeleton filaments, bacterial and eukaryotic cells allowing them to be modelled as rod-like elements to which nematic liquid crystal theories can be applied.

While regional variations in cellular forces or cell proliferation have been typically assumed to be the main physical factors controlling tissue morphogenesis, recent experiments have revealed that spatial variations in the tissue physical (fluid/solid) state play a key role in shaping embryonic tissues. Here we theoretically study how the regional control of fluid and solid tissue states guides morphogenetic flows to shape the extending vertebrate body axis. Our results show that both the existence of a fluid-to-solid tissue transition along the anteroposterior axis and the tissue surface tension determine the shape of the tissue and its ability to elongate unidirectionally, with large tissue tensions preventing unidirectional elongation and promoting blob-like tissue expansions. We predict both the tissue morphogenetic flows and stresses that enable unidirectional axis elongation. Our results show the existence of a sharp transition in the structure of morphogenetic flows, from a flow with no vortices to a flow with two counter-rotating vortices, caused by a transition in the number and location of topological defects in the flow field. Finally, comparing the theoretical predictions to quantitative measurements of both tissue flows and shape during zebrafish body axis elongation, we show that the observed morphogenetic events can be explained by the existence of a fluid-to-solid tissue transition along the anteroposterior axis. These results highlight the role of spatiotemporally-controlled fluid-to-solid transitions in the tissue state as a physical mechanism of embryonic morphogenesis.},

Similarly, biological and biochemical signals are known to influence the abilities of cells to sense, generate and bear mechanical forces. Studies into the mechanics of single cells, subcellular components and biological molecules have rapidly evolved during the past decade with significant implications for biotechnology and human health. This progress has been facilitated by new capabilities for measuring forces and displacements with piconewton and nanometre resolutions, respectively, and by improvements in bio-imaging. Details of mechanical, chemical and biological interactions in cells remain elusive. However, the mechanical deformation of proteins and nucleic acids may provide key insights for understanding the changes in cellular structure, response and function under force, and offer new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. This review discusses some basic features of the deformation of single cells and biomolecules, and examines opportunities for further research.},

We accomplish this by combining highly controlled experiments on different film-rupture patterns with computer simulations using novel numerical schemes for thin-film equations. For the quantitative comparison of the pattern evolution in both experiment and simulation we introduce a novel pattern analysis method based on Minkowski measures.

External mechanical stimuli are increasingly recognized as determinants of cell behavior. In the epithelial folding event that constitutes the beginning of gastrulation in Drosophila, the genetic program of the future mesoderm leads to the establishment of a contractile actomyosin network that triggers apical constriction of cells and thereby tissue folding. However, some cells do not constrict but instead stretch, even though they share the same genetic program as their constricting neighbors. We show here that tissue-wide interactions force these cells to expand even when an otherwise sufficient amount of apical, active actomyosin is present. Models based on contractile forces and linear stress\textendash strain responses do not reproduce experimental observations, but simulations in which cells behave as ductile materials with nonlinear mechanical properties do. Our models show that this behavior is a general emergent property of actomyosin networks in a supracellular context, in accordance with our experimental observations of actin reorganization within stretching cells.},

Nematic defects are found at the interface between domains with a total number that remains constant due to the dynamical balance of nucleation and annihilation events. The mean velocity fields in the vicinity of defects are well described by a hydrodynamic theory of extensile active nematics.},

Triggered by an interplay between biochemical and mechanical signals, epithelia form complex tissues by undergoing coordinated cell shape changes, but how such spatiotemporal coordination is controlled remains an open question. To dissect biochemical signaling from purely mechanical cues, we developed a microfluidic system that experimentally triggers epithelial folding to recapitulate stereotypic deformations observed in vivo. Using this system, we observe that the apical or basal direction of folding results in strikingly different mechanical states at the fold boundary, where the balance between tissue tension and torque (arising from the imposed curvature) controls the spread of folding-induced calcium waves at a short timescale and induces spatial patterns of gene expression at longer timescales. Our work uncovers that folding-associated gradients of cell shape and their resulting mechanical stresses direct spatially distinct biochemical responses within the monolayer.},

By controlling the geometry and cellular density, we generated centimetre-scale tissues that comprise self-organized features such as lumens, branched vasculature and tubular intestinal epithelia with in vivo-like crypts and villus domains. Supporting cells were deposited to modulate morphogenesis in space and time, and different epithelial cells were printed sequentially to mimic the organ boundaries present in the gastrointestinal tract. We thus show how biofabrication and organoid technology can be merged to control tissue self-organization from millimetre to centimetre scales, opening new avenues for drug discovery, diagnostics and regenerative medicine.},

Here we show by direct experimental measurement that these two mechanisms are insufficient to explain force patterns observed during wound closure. At early stages of the process, leading actin protrusions generate traction forces that point away from the wound, showing that wound closure is initially driven by cell crawling. At later stages, we observed unanticipated patterns of traction forces pointing towards the wound. Such patterns have strong force components that are both radial and tangential to the wound. We show that these force components arise from tensions transmitted by a heterogeneous actomyosin ring to the underlying substrate through focal adhesions. The structural and mechanical organization reported here provides cells with a mechanism to close the wound by cooperatively compressing the underlying substrate.},

We demonstrate that this is partly regulated by cellular contractility and extracellular matrix development, underscoring the mechanical nature of curvature guidance.

  abstract = {Abstract Segregating cells into compartments during embryonic development is essential for growth and pattern formation. Physical mechanisms shaping compartment boundaries were recently explored in Drosophila, where actomyosin-based barriers were revealed to be important for keeping cells apart. In vertebrates, interhombomeric boundaries are straight interfaces, which often serve as signaling centers that pattern the surrounding tissue. Here, we demonstrate that in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos cell sorting sharpens the molecular boundaries and, once borders are straight, actomyosin barriers are key to keeping rhombomeric cells segregated. Actomyosin cytoskeletal components are enriched at interhombomeric boundaries, forming cable-like structures in the apical side of the neuroepithelial cells by the time morphological boundaries are visible. When myosin II function is inhibited, cable structures do not form, leading to rhombomeric cell mixing. Downregulation of EphA4a compromises actomyosin cables and cells with different rhombomeric identity intermingle, and the phenotype is rescued enhancing myosin II activity. Moreover, enrichment of actomyosin structures is obtained when EphA4 is ectopically expressed in even-numbered rhombomeres. These findings suggest that mechanical barriers act downstream of EphA/ephrin signaling to segregate cells from different rhombomeres.},

Here we describe a novel method, to our knowledge, for using force spectroscopy approach curves with tipless cantilevers to determine the actomyosin cortical tension, elastic modulus, and intracellular pressure of nonadherent cells. We validated the method by measuring the surface tension of water in oil microdrops deposited on a glass surface. We extracted an average tension of T {$\sim$} 20.25 nN/{$\mu$}m, which agrees with macroscopic experimental methods. We then measured cortical mechanical properties in nonadherent human foreskin fibroblasts and THP-1 human monocytes before and after pharmacological perturbations of actomyosin activity. Our results show that myosin II activity and actin polymerization increase cortex tension and intracellular pressure, whereas branched actin networks decreased them. Interestingly, myosin II activity stiffens the cortex and branched actin networks soften it, but actin polymerization has no effect on cortex stiffness. Our method is capable of detecting changes in cell mechanical properties in response to perturbations of the cytoskeleton, allowing characterization with physically relevant parameters. Altogether, this simple method should be of broad application for deciphering the molecular regulation of cell cortical mechanical properties.},

Here, we demonstrate that for a variety of synthetic and physiological hydrogel substrates the formation of epithelial cracks is caused by tissue stretching independently of epithelial tension. We show that the origin of the cracks is hydraulic; they result from a transient pressure build-up in the substrate during stretch and compression manoeuvres. After pressure equilibration, cracks heal readily through actomyosin-dependent mechanisms. The observed phenomenology is captured by the theory of poroelasticity, which predicts the size and healing dynamics of epithelial cracks as a function of the stiffness, geometry and composition of the hydrogel substrate. Our findings demonstrate that epithelial integrity is determined in a tension-independent manner by the coupling between tissue stretching and matrix hydraulics.},

During development, spatial topography is determined by gradients of signaling molecules released from discrete signaling centers. We hypothesized that introduction of a signaling center into forebrain organoids would specify the positional identity of neural tissue in a distance-dependent manner. Here, we present a system to trigger a Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein gradient in developing forebrain organoids that enables ordered self-organization along dorso-ventral and antero-posterior positional axes. SHH-patterned forebrain organoids establish major forebrain subdivisions that are positioned with in vivo-like topography. Consistent with its behavior in vivo, SHH exhibits long-range signaling activity in organoids. Finally, we use SHH-patterned cerebral organoids as a tool to study the role of cholesterol metabolism in SHH signaling. Together, this work identifies inductive signaling as an effective organizing strategy to recapitulate in vivo-like topography in human brain organoids.},

  abstract = {An epithelial cell line (MDCK) was used to prepare monolayers which, in vitro, develop properties of transporting epithelia. Monolayers were formed by plating cells at high densities (10(6) cells/cm2) on collagen-coated nylon cloth disks to saturate the area available for attachment, thus avoiding the need for cell division. An electrical resistance developed within 4-6 h after plating and achieved a steady-state value of 104 +/- 1.8 omega-cm2 after 24 h. Mature monolayers were morphologically and functionally polarized. They contained junctional complexes composed of desmosomes and tight junctions with properties similar to those of "leaky" epithelia. Monolayers were capable of maintaining a spontaneous electrical potential sensitive to amiloride, produced a net water flux from the apical to basal side, and discriminated between Na+ and Cl- ions. The MDCK permeability barrier behaves as a "thin" membrane with negatively charged sites. It has: (a) a linear conductance/concentration relationship; (b) an asymmetric instantaneous current/voltage relationship; (c) a reduced ability to discriminate between Na+ and Cl- caused by lowering the pH; and (d) a characteristic pattern of ionic selectivity which suggests that the negatively charged sites are highly hydrates and of medium field strength. Measurements of Na+ permeability of electrical and tracer methods ruled out exchange diffusion as a mechanism for ion permeation and the lack of current saturation in the I/deltapsi curves does not support the involvement of carriers. The discrimination between Na+ and Cl- was severely but reversibly decreased at low pH, suggesting that Na+-specific channels which exclude Cl- contain acidic groups dissociated at neutral pH. Bound Ca++ ions are involved in maintaining the integrity of the junctions in MDCK monolayers as was shown by a reversible drop of resistance and opening of the junctions in Ca++-free medium containing EGTA. Several other epithelial cell lines are capable of developing a significant resistance under the conditions used to obtain MDCK monolayers.},

During elongation the follicular epithelial cells undergo a collective migration that causes the egg chamber to rotate within its surrounding basement membrane. Rotation coincides with the formation of a `molecular corset', in which actin bundles in the epithelium and fibrils in the basement membrane are all aligned perpendicular to the elongation axis. Here we show that rotation plays a critical role in building the actin-based component of the corset. Rotation begins shortly after egg chamber formation and requires lamellipodial protrusions at each follicle cell's leading edge. During early stages, rotation is necessary for tissue-level actin bundle alignment, but it becomes dispensable after the basement membrane is polarized. This work highlights how collective cell migration can be used to build a polarized tissue organization for organ morphogenesis.},

This process of sensing external stimuli is called mechanosensitivity. Physical forces regulate physiological processes in human body, and dysfunctional processes may result in diseases. The mechanosensing of cells can only be understood by systematic experiments, and these experiments need sophisticated laboratory appara- tuses for mechanical stimulation of cells. In this work, we construct a custom miniature fluid shear device which may be used to apply shear stresses ranging from (0.5 to 8 Pa) through a cone plate rheometric method. This device is compact and light to be mounted on inverted microscope for visualizing cell cytoskeleton deformations live. We are in process of securing Indian patent, and due to patent disclosure we only report ideation and calibration of device. This device can be used for studying cell mechanobiology and rheology of other soft matter.},

However, scant attention has been paid to address the challenge of reproducing mucosal folding. Here we mimic the mucosal folding process using a cell-laden hydrogel film attached to a prestretched tough-hydrogel substrate. The cell-laden hydrogel constitutes a human epithelial cell lining on stromal component to recapitulate the physiological feature of a mucosa. Relaxation of the prestretched tough-hydrogel substrate applies compressive strains on the cell-laden hydrogel film, which undergoes mechanical instability and evolves into morphological patterns. We predict the conditions for mucosal folding as well as the morphology of and strain in the folded artificial mucosa using a combination of theory and simulation. The work not only provides a simple method to fold artificial mucosa but also demonstrates a paradigm in tissue engineering via harnessing mechanical instabilities guided by quantitative mechanics models.},

Although the role of cell proliferation in these processes has been widely studied, the mechanisms that control embryo size\textemdash and how these mechanisms affect cell fate\textemdash remain unknown. Here we use the mouse blastocyst as a model to unravel a key role of fluid-filled lumen in the control of embryo size and specification of cell fate. We find that there is a twofold increase in lumenal pressure during blastocyst development, which translates into a concomitant increase in cell cortical tension and tissue stiffness of the trophectoderm that lines the lumen. Increased cortical tension leads to vinculin mechanosensing and maturation of functional tight junctions, which establishes a positive feedback loop to accommodate lumen growth. When the cortical tension reaches a critical threshold, cell\textendash cell adhesion cannot be sustained during mitotic entry, which leads to trophectoderm rupture and blastocyst collapse. A simple theory of hydraulically gated oscillations recapitulates the observed dynamics of size oscillations, and predicts the scaling of embryo size with tissue volume. This theory further predicts that disrupted tight junctions or increased tissue stiffness lead to a smaller embryo size, which we verified by biophysical, embryological, pharmacological and genetic perturbations. Changes in lumenal pressure and size can influence the cell division pattern of the trophectoderm, and thereby affect cell allocation and fate. Our study reveals how lumenal pressure and tissue mechanics control embryo size at the tissue scale, which is coupled to cell position and fate at the cellular scale.},

  abstract = {Apical\textendash basal polarity is essential for the formation and function of epithelial tissues, whereas loss of polarity is a hallmark of tumours. Studies in Drosophila have identified conserved polarity factors that define the apical (Crumbs, Stardust, Par-6, atypical protein kinase C [aPKC]), junctional (Bazooka [Baz]/Par-3), and basolateral (Scribbled [Scrib], Discs large [Dlg], Lethal [2] giant larvae [Lgl]) domains of epithelial cells. Because these conserved factors mark equivalent domains in diverse types of vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia, it is generally assumed that this system underlies polarity in all epithelia. Here, we show that this is not the case, as none of these canonical factors are required for the polarisation of the endodermal epithelium of the Drosophila adult midgut. Furthermore, like vertebrate epithelia but not other Drosophila epithelia, the midgut epithelium forms occluding junctions above adherens junctions (AJs) and requires the integrin adhesion complex for polarity. Thus, Drosophila contains two types of epithelia that polarise by fundamentally different mechanisms. This diversity of epithelial types may reflect their different developmental origins, junctional arrangement, or whether they polarise in an apical\textendash basal direction or vice versa. Since knock-outs of canonical polarity factors in vertebrates often have little or no effect on epithelial polarity and the Drosophila midgut shares several common features with vertebrate epithelia, this diversity of polarity mechanisms is likely to be conserved in other animals.},

Here, using a microfluidic platform to recapitulate fluid transport activity of kidney cells, we report that renal epithelial cells can actively generate hydraulic pressure gradients across the epithelium. The fluidic flux declines with increasing hydraulic pressure until a stall pressure, in a manner similar to mechanical fluid pumps. For normal human kidney cells, the fluidic flux is from apical to basal, and the pressure is higher on the basal side. For human Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease cells, the fluidic flux is reversed from basal to apical. Molecular and proteomic studies reveal that renal epithelial cells are sensitive to hydraulic pressure gradients, changing gene expression profiles and spatial arrangements of ion exchangers and the cytoskeleton in different pressure conditions. These results implicate mechanical force and hydraulic pressure as important variables during kidney function and morphological change, and provide insights into pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development and transduction of hydraulic pressure gradients.},

  abstract = {Active fluid transport across epithelial monolayers is emerging as a major driving force of tissue morphogenesis in a variety of healthy and diseased systems, as well as during embryonic development. Cells use directional transport of ions and osmotic gradients to drive fluid flow across the cell surface, in the process also building up fluid pressure. The basic physics of this process is described by the osmotic engine model, which also underlies actin-independent cell migration. Recently, the trans-epithelial fluid flux and the hydraulic pressure gradient have been explicitly measured for a variety of cellular and tissue model systems across various species. For the kidney, it was shown that tubular epithelial cells behave as active mechanical fluid pumps: the trans-epithelial fluid flux depends on the hydraulic pressure difference across the epithelial layer. When a stall pressure is reached, the fluid flux vanishes. Hydraulic forces generated from active fluid pumping are important in tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis, and could also underlie multiple morphogenic events seen in other developmental contexts. In this review, we highlight findings that examined the role of trans-epithelial fluid flux and hydraulic pressure gradient in driving tissue-scale morphogenesis. We also review organ pathophysiology due to impaired fluid pumping and the loss of hydraulic pressure sensing at the cellular scale. Finally, we draw an analogy between cellular fluidic pumps and a connected network of water pumps in a city. The dynamics of fluid transport in an active and adaptive network is determined globally at the systemic level, and transport in such a network is best when each pump is operating at its optimal efficiency.},

  abstract = {Tissue morphogenesis relies on the production of~active cellular forces. Understanding how such forces are mechanically converted into cell shape changes is essential to our understanding of morphogenesis. Here, we use myosin II pulsatile activity during Drosophila embryogenesis to study how transient forces generate irreversible cell shape changes. Analyzing the dynamics of junction shortening and elongation resulting from myosin II pulses, we find that long pulses yield less reversible deformations, typically a signature of dissipative mechanics. This is consistent with a simple viscoelastic description, which we use to model individual shortening and elongation events. The model predicts that dissipation typically occurs on the minute timescale, a timescale commensurate with that of force generation by myosin II pulses. We test this estimate by applying time-controlled forces on junctions with optical tweezers. Finally, we show that actin turnover participates in dissipation, as reducing it pharmacologically increases the reversibility of contractile events. Our results argue that active junctional deformation is stabilized by actin-dependent dissipation. Hence, tissue morphogenesis requires coordination between force generation and dissipation.},

Our protocol establishes apical-out polarity rapidly (24\textendash 48 h), preserves epithelial integrity, maintains secretory and absorptive functions and allows regulation of differentiation. Here, we provide a detailed description of the organoid polarity reversal method, compatible characterization assays and an example of an application of the technology\textemdash specifically the impact of host\textendash microbe interactions on epithelial function.

Although mechanobiology has been widely studied in two-dimensional configurations, limited research has been conducted in three-dimensional (3D) systems due to the complex nature of mechanics and cellular behaviors. In this study, we established a platform integrating a well-defined synthetic hydrogel system (PEG-4MAL) with 3D traction force microscopy (TFM) methodologies to evaluate deformation and force responses within synthetic microenvironments, providing insights that are not tractable using biological matrices because of the interdependence of biochemical and biophysical properties and complex mechanics. We dissected the contributions of adhesive peptide density and polymer density, which determines hydrogel stiffness, to 3D force generation for fibroblasts. A critical threshold of adhesive peptide density at a constant matrix elasticity is required for cells to generate 3D forces. Furthermore, matrix displacements and strains decreased with matrix stiffness whereas stresses, and tractions increased with matrix stiffness until reaching constant values at higher stiffness values. Finally, Rho-kinase-dependent contractility and vinculin expression are required to generate significant 3D forces in both collagen and synthetic hydrogels. This research establishes a tunable platform for the study of mechanobiology and provides new insights into how cells sense and transmit forces in 3D.},

  abstract = {How the shape of embryos and organs emerges during development is a fundamental question that has fascinated scientists for centuries. Tissue dynamics arise from a small set of cell behaviours, including shape changes, cell contact remodelling, cell migration, cell division and cell extrusion. These behaviours require control over cell mechanics, namely active stresses associated with protrusive, contractile and adhesive forces, and hydrostatic pressure, as well as material properties of cells that dictate how cells respond to active stresses. In this Review, we address how cell mechanics and the associated cell behaviours are robustly organized in space and time during tissue morphogenesis. We first outline how not only gene expression and the resulting biochemical cues, but also mechanics and geometry act as sources of morphogenetic information to ultimately define the time and length scales of the cell behaviours driving morphogenesis. Next, we present two idealized modes of how this information flows \textemdash{} how it is read out and translated into a biological effect \textemdash{} during morphogenesis. The first, akin to a programme, follows deterministic rules and is hierarchical. The second follows the principles of self-organization, which rests on statistical rules characterizing the system's composition and configuration, local interactions and feedback. We discuss the contribution of these two modes to the mechanisms of four very general classes of tissue deformation, namely tissue folding and invagination, tissue flow and extension, tissue hollowing and, finally, tissue branching. Overall, we suggest a conceptual framework for understanding morphogenetic information that encapsulates genetics and biochemistry as well as mechanics and geometry as information modules, and the interplay of deterministic and self-organized mechanisms of their deployment, thereby diverging considerably from the traditional notion that shape is fully encoded and determined by genes.},

  abstract = {Directional migration is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. Among other external signals, the architecture of the extracellular matrix can trigger directed cell migration through a phenomenon known as contact guidance: cells elongate, align, and migrate along the direction set by aligned extracellular matrix fibers. This process involves the orientation of focal adhesions, actin, and tubulin cytoskeleton along the direction of those fibers. Contact guidance has been extensively studied on stiff materials with topographical grooved patterns. However, how it translates to softer physiologically relevant compliances is not known. Here we show that substrate stiffness modulates the cellular response to topographical contact guidance. We found that for fibroblasts, while focal adhesions and actin responded to topography independently of the stiffness, microtubules showed a stiffness-dependent response that regulates contact guidance. On the other hand, both clusters and single breast carcinoma epithelial cells displayed stiffness-dependent contact guidance migration, leading to more directional and efficient migration when increasing substrate stiffness. These results suggest that both matrix stiffening and alignment of extracellular matrix fibers cooperate during directional cell migration, and both should be accounted when studying processes such as cancer cell invasion. Teaser Changes in the stiffness of topographical patterns modify how mesenchymal and epithelial cells perform contact guidance.},

A common assumption is that biofilms exclusively interact with their hosts biochemically. However, the contributions of mechanics, while being central to the process of biofilm formation, have been overlooked as a factor influencing host physiology. Specifically, how biofilms form on soft, tissue-like materials remains unknown. Here, we show that biofilms of the pathogens Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can induce large deformations of soft synthetic hydrogels. Biofilms buildup internal mechanical stress as single cells grow within the elastic matrix. By combining mechanical measurements and mutations in matrix components, we found that biofilms deform by buckling, and that adhesion transmits these forces to their substrates. Finally, we demonstrate that V. cholerae biofilms can generate sufficient mechanical stress to deform and even disrupt soft epithelial cell monolayers, suggesting a mechanical mode of infection.},

We highlight experimental embryology studies, including organoids and xenobots, that go beyond the familiar, default outcomes of embryogenesis, revealing the plasticity, interoperability and problem-solving capacities of life. In addition to traditional bottom-up engineering of genes and proteins, design strategies can be pursued based on modelling cell collectives as agential materials, with their own goals, agendas and powers of problem-solving. Such an agential bioengineering approach could transform developmental biology, regenerative medicine and robotics, building on frameworks that include active, computational and agential matter.},

However, the basic mechanisms underlying the dynamics of confined cell assemblies remain largely to be deciphered and would greatly benefit from well-controlled in vitro experiments. Here we show that confluent epithelial cells cultured on finite population-sized domains, exhibit collective low-frequency radial displacement modes as well as stochastic global rotation reversals. A simple mathematical model, in which cells are described as persistent random walkers that adapt their motion to that of their neighbours, captures the essential characteristics of these breathing oscillations. As these epithelia mature, a tri-dimensional peripheral cell cord develops at the domain edge by differential extrusion, as a result of the additional degrees of freedom of the border cells. These results demonstrate that epithelial confinement alone can induce morphogenesis-like processes including spontaneous collective pulsations and transition from 2D to 3D.},

In the spinal cord, neural progenitor cells are directed to differentiate into adult neurons through the action of mediators released from nearby organizing centers, such as the floor plate and paraxial mesoderm. These signals combine to create spatiotemporal diffusional landscapes that precisely regulate the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, in vivo and ex vivo studies of these signaling factors present some inherent ambiguity. In vitro methods are preferred for their enhanced experimental clarity but often lack the technical sophistication required for biological realism. In this article, we present a versatile microfluidic platform capable of mimicking the spatial and temporal chemical environments found in vivo during neural tube development. Simultaneous opposing and/or orthogonal gradients of developmental morphogens can be maintained, resulting in neural tube patterning analogous to that observed in vivo.},

Consequently, the development of hydrogel-based microvessel-on-chip systems that strive to mimic the in vivo cellular organization and mechanical environment has received great attention in recent years. However, despite intensive efforts, current microvessel-on-chip systems suffer from several limitations, most notably failure to produce physiologically relevant wall strain levels. In this study, a novel microvessel-on-chip based on the templating technique and using luminal flow actuation to generate physiologically relevant levels of wall shear stress and circumferential stretch is presented. Normal forces induced by the luminal pressure compress the surrounding soft collagen hydrogel, dilate the channel, and create large circumferential strain. The fluid pressure gradient in the system drives flow forward and generates realistic pulsatile wall shear stresses. Rigorous characterization of the system reveals the crucial role played by the poroelastic behavior of the hydrogel in determining the magnitudes of the wall shear stress and strain. The experimental measurements are combined with an analytical model of flow in both the lumen and the porous hydrogel to provide an exceptionally versatile user manual for an application-based choice of parameters in microvessels-on-chip. This unique strategy of flow actuation adds a dimension to the capabilities of microvessel-on-chip systems and provides a more general framework for improving hydrogel-based in vitro engineered platforms.},

Our sensors are polyacrylamide microbeads of well-defined elasticity, size and surface coating to enable internalization within the cellular environment. By isotropically compressing multicellular spheroids (MCS), which are spherical aggregates of cells mimicking a tumour, we show that the pressure is transmitted in a non-trivial manner inside the MCS, with a pressure rise towards the core. This observed pressure profile is explained by the anisotropic arrangement of cells and our results suggest that such anisotropy alone is sufficient to explain the pressure rise inside MCS composed of a single cell type. Furthermore, such pressure distribution suggests a direct link between increased mechanical stress and previously observed lack of proliferation within the spheroids core.},

First, we show that the actin cytoskeleton protein Zasp52 is specifically required for actin cable formation. Next, we used Zasp52 loss of function to dissect the mechanism of action of the cable. Surprisingly, closure dynamics are perfect in Zasp52 mutants: the cable is therefore dispensable for closure, even in the absence of the amnioserosa. Conversely, we observed that the cable protects cellular geometries from robust morphogenetic forces that otherwise interfere with closure: the absence of cable results in defects in epithelial organization that lead to morphogenetic scarring. We propose that the cable prevents morphogenetic scarring by stabilizing cellular interactions rather than by acting on closure dynamics.},

  abstract = {In animals, cellularization of a coenocyte is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium during early embryonic development. It is characterized by coordinated assembly of an actomyosin network, which drives inward membrane invaginations. However, whether coordinated cellularization driven by membrane invagination exists outside animals is not known. To that end, we investigate cellularization in the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma arctica, a close unicellular relative of animals. We show that the process of cellularization involves coordinated inward plasma membrane invaginations dependent on an actomyosin network and reveal the temporal order of its assembly. This leads to the formation of a polarized layer of cells resembling an epithelium. We show that this stage is associated with tightly regulated transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell adhesion. Hereby we demonstrate the presence of a self-organized, clonally-generated, polarized layer of cells in a unicellular relative of animals.},

A reversible differentiation leads to the formation of two types of microstructure (domes and ridges); this paper is concerned with the mechanism of dome formation. This differentiation is initiated by inducers, some of which are generated in the cultures and act locally; their effect is strongly dependent on cell concentration and requires hydrocortisone. There are, in addition, exogenous inducers as well as inhibitors. In the pathway to dome formation important roles are played by cAMP (probably both intracellular and extracellular), the organization of the cytoskeleton, and the Thy-1 antigen. The pathway and the significance of the phenomenon for mammary gland development are discussed.},

  abstract = {The ability of tissues to sustain mechanical stress and avoid fracture is a fundamental pillar of their function. Fracture in response to physiological levels of stress can be undesired, for example resulting from disease or genetic mutations, or be an integral part of developmental processes, such as during blastocoel formation in mouse or during leg eversion in flies. Despite its importance, we know very little about fracture in cellularised tissues because it is a multi-scale process that necessitates comprehension of the interplay between mechanical forces and processes at the molecular and cellular scales. Using a combination of mechanical measurements, live imaging and computational modelling, we characterise fracture in epithelial monolayers. We show that, despite consisting of only a single layer of cells, monolayers can withstand surprisingly large deformations, often accommodating several-fold increases in their length before rupture. To protect against large deformation, epithelia increase their stiffness multiple-fold in a process controlled by keratin intermediate filaments. Perturbing keratin organisation fragilised monolayers and prevented strain stiffening. Using computational approaches, we show that, although the kinetics of bond rupture ultimately control fracture, tissue rheology and the history of deformation prior to failure set the strain and stress that the tissue reaches at the onset of fracture. Our data paint a picture of epithelia as versatile materials that combine resistance to shocks with deformability when subjected to low strain rates.},

Inhibiting cell-contractility further revealed that active cellular forces are essential for generating sufficient surface stresses for the liquid-like behavior and growth of the tissue.

If the rate of death exceeds proliferation, epithelial barrier function could become compromised; if it lags behind proliferation, cells could amass into tumors. Although the balance between cell death and division is critical for preventing pathology, most studies focus on each process in isolation. Loss of contact inhibition is a hallmark of cancer cells and has suggested that cell contacts are important for linking rates of cell division and death. However, epithelial cells continuously divide and die while maintaining contacts with each other, so other factors must control this balance. Recent studies have found that cell-crowding forces from cell proliferation can drive cells to die by extrusion from the epithelium. Factors that alter this response to cell crowding may lead to barrier function diseases or promote hyperplasia and cancer.},

We demonstrate that force transmission is regulated by a dynamic clutch mechanism, which unveils its fundamental biphasic force/rigidity relationship on talin depletion. Force transduction is triggered by talin unfolding above a stiffness threshold. Below this threshold, integrins unbind and release force before talin can unfold. Above the threshold, talin unfolds and binds to vinculin, leading to adhesion growth and YAP nuclear translocation. Matrix density, myosin contractility, integrin ligation and talin mechanical stability differently and nonlinearly regulate both force transmission and the transduction threshold. In all cases, coupling of talin unfolding dynamics to a theoretical clutch model quantitatively predicts cell response.},

Exposure to a stiff environment leads cells to establish a mechanical connection between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton, allowing forces exerted through focal adhesions to reach the nucleus. Force transmission then leads to nuclear flattening, which stretches nuclear pores, reduces their mechanical resistance to molecular transport, and increases YAP nuclear import. The restriction to transport is further regulated by the mechanical stability of the transported protein, which determines both active nuclear transport of YAP and passive transport of small proteins. Our results unveil a mechanosensing mechanism mediated directly by nuclear pores, demonstrated for YAP but with potential general applicability in transcriptional regulation.},

Matrix viscoelasticity prompts symmetry breaking of the spheroid, leading to the formation of invading finger-like protrusions, YAP nuclear translocation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition both in vitro and in vivo in a Arp2/3-complex-dependent manner. Computational modelling of these observations allows us to establish a phase diagram relating morphological stability with matrix viscoelasticity, tissue viscosity, cell motility and cell division rate, which is experimentally validated by biochemical assays and in vitro experiments with an intestinal organoid. Altogether, this work highlights the role of stress relaxation mechanisms in tissue growth dynamics, a fundamental process in morphogenesis and oncogenesis.},

Both ECM motion and tissue deformation require multicellular scale coordination, however the interplay between them remain largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism coupling morphogenetic events and epithelia-driven ECM flow in vitro. We show that exposure to ECM components triggers periodic morphogenesis of dome-shaped structures in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) monolayers, driven by directional ECM flow. We show that this flow is initiated by local symmetry breaking events, is driven by microvilli and requires unperturbed flow conditions, microvilli function, and cytoskeletal contractility. An in silico model shows that a reaction-diffusion-like mechanism is responsible for organizing local morphogenesis into global tissue-wide events. We validate this model by predicting changes in cell patterning landscape during mesoderm differentiation, and demonstrate changes in cellular identity by immunohistochemistry and scRNAseq. These results demonstrate that transport of ECM over epithelia, termed ECM flow, is a major contributor in sustaining morphogenesis and differentiation. Our in vitro approach suggests that ECM flow may be a broadly conserved mechanism guiding multicellular morphogenesis and may be further explored to investigate the role of ECM transport in other model systems.},

While much is now understood of the molecular mechanism responsible for apical constriction and of the tissue-scale integration of the ensuing in-plane deformations, it is still not clear if apical actomyosin contraction forces are necessary or sufficient per se to drive tissue folding. To tackle this question, we use the Drosophila embryo model system that forms a furrow on the ventral side, initiating mesoderm internalization. Past computational models support the idea that cell apical contraction forces may not be sufficient and that active or passive cell apico-basal forces may be necessary to drive cell wedging leading to tissue furrowing. By using 3D computational modelling and in toto embryo image analysis and manipulation, we now challenge this idea and show that embryo-scale force balance at the tissue surface, rather than cell-autonomous shape changes, is necessary and sufficient to drive a buckling of the epithelial surface forming a furrow which propagates and initiates embryo gastrulation.},

  abstract = {The shaping of the human embryo begins with compaction, during which cells come into close contact and form a tighter structure1,2. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) studies suggest that human embryos fail compaction primarily because of defective adhesion3,4. Based on our current understanding of animal morphogenesis5,6, other morphogenetic engines, such as cell contractility, could be involved in shaping the human embryo. However, the molecular, cellular and physical mechanisms driving human embryo morphogenesis remain uncharacterized. Using micropipette aspiration on human embryos donated to research, we have mapped cell surface tensions during compaction. This reveals a 4-fold increase of tension at the cellmedium interface while cell-cell contacts keep a steady tension. Comparison between human and mouse reveals qualitatively similar but quantitively different mechanical strategies, with human embryos being mechanically least efficient. Inhibition of cell contractility and cell-cell adhesion in human embryos reveal that only contractility controls the surface tension responsible for compaction. Interestingly, if both cellular processes are required for compaction, they exhibit distinct mechanical signatures when faulty. Analyzing the mechanical signature of naturally failing embryos, we find evidence that non-compacting embryos or partially compacting embryos with excluded cells have defective contractility. Together, our study reveals that an evolutionarily conserved increase in cell contractility is required to generate the forces driving the first morphogenetic movement shaping the human body.},

Recent work has demonstrated that both internal and external physical forces can act through the cytoskeleton to affect local mechanical properties and cellular behaviour. Attention is now focused on how cytoskeletal networks generate, transmit and respond to mechanical signals over both short and long timescales. An important insight emerging from this work is that long-lived cytoskeletal structures may act as epigenetic determinants of cell shape, function and fate.},

  abstract = {Directed cell migration is an essential building block of life, present when an embryo develops, a dendritic cell migrates toward a lymphatic vessel, or a fibrotic organ fails to restore its normal parenchyma. Directed cell migration is often guided by spatial gradients in a physicochemical property of the cell microenvironment, such as a gradient in chemical factors dissolved in the medium or a gradient in the mechanical properties of the substrate. Single cells and tissues sense these gradients, establish a back-to-front polarity, and coordinate the migration machinery accordingly. Central to these steps we find physical forces. In some cases, these forces are integrated into the gradient sensing mechanism. Other times, they transmit information through cells and tissues to coordinate a collective response. At any time, they participate in the cellular migratory system. In this review, we explore the role of physical forces in gradient sensing, polarization, and coordinating movement from single cells to multicellular collectives. We use the framework proposed by the molecular clutch model and explore to what extent asymmetries in the different elements of the clutch can lead to directional migration.},

  abstract = {Epithelial monolayers are two-dimensional cell sheets which compartmentalize the body and organs of multicellular organisms. Their morphogenesis during development or pathology results from patterned endogenous and exogenous forces and their interplay with tissue mechanical properties. In particular, bending of epithelia is thought to result from active torques generated by the polarization of myosin motors along their apicobasal axis. However, the contribution of these out-of-plane forces to morphogenesis remains challenging to evaluate because of the lack of direct mechanical measurement. Here we use epithelial curling to characterize the out-of-plane mechanics of epithelial monolayers. We find that curls of high curvature form spontaneously at the free edge of epithelial monolayers devoid of substrate in vivo and in vitro. Curling originates from an enrichment of myosin in the basal domain that generates an active spontaneous curvature. By measuring the force necessary to flatten curls, we can then estimate the active torques and the bending modulus of the tissue. Finally, we show that the extent of curling is controlled by the interplay between in-plane and out-of-plane stresses in the monolayer. Such mechanical coupling emphasizes a possible role for in-plane stresses in shaping epithelia during morphogenesis.},

Whether this tissue-level mechanical transition impacts phenotypes during carcinoma progression remains unclear. Here we report that the large fluctuations in cell density that accompany unjamming result in repeated mechanical deformations of cells and nuclei. This triggers a cellular mechano-protective mechanism involving an increase in nuclear size and rigidity, heterochromatin redistribution and remodelling of the perinuclear actin architecture into actin rings. The chronic strains and stresses associated with unjamming together with the reduction of Lamin B1 levels eventually result in DNA damage and nuclear envelope ruptures, with the release of cytosolic DNA that activates a cGAS\textendash STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\textendash signalling adaptor stimulator of interferon genes)-dependent cytosolic DNA response gene program. This mechanically driven transcriptional rewiring ultimately alters the cell state, with the emergence of malignant traits, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity phenotypes and chemoresistance in invasive breast carcinoma.},

Here, we show that the actin cortex of leukocytes is mechanoresponsive and that this responsiveness requires neither force sensing via the nucleus nor adhesive interactions with a substrate. Upon global compression of the cell body as well as local indentation of the plasma membrane, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) assembles into dot-like structures, providing activation platforms for Arp2/3 nucleated actin patches. These patches locally push against the external load, which can be obstructing collagen fibers or other cells, and thereby create space to facilitate forward locomotion. We show in~vitro and in~vivo that this WASp function is rate limiting for ameboid leukocyte migration in dense but not in loose environments and is required for trafficking through diverse tissues such as skin and lymph nodes.},

The folded shape of the human brain allows the cerebral cortex, the thin outer layer of neurons and their associated projections, to attain a large surface area relative to brain volume. Abnormal cortical folding has been associated with severe neurological, cognitive and behavioural disorders, such as epilepsy, autism and schizophrenia. However, despite decades of study, the mechanical forces that lead to cortical folding remain incompletely understood. Leading hypotheses have focused on the roles of (i) tangential growth of the outer cortex, (ii) spatio-temporal patterns in the birth and migration of neurons, and (iii) internal tension in axons. Recent experimental studies have illuminated not only the fundamental cellular and molecular processes underlying cortical development, but also the stress state, mechanical properties and spatio-temporal patterns of growth in the developing brain. The combination of mathematical modelling and physical measurements has allowed researchers to evaluate hypothesized mechanisms of folding, to determine whether each is consistent with physical laws. This review summarizes what physical scientists have learned from models and recent experimental observations, in the context of recent neurobiological discoveries regarding cortical development. Here, we highlight evidence of a combined mechanism, in which spatio-temporal patterns bias the locations of primary folds (i), but tangential growth of the cortical plate induces mechanical instability (ii) to propagate primary and higher-order folds.

We present a high-throughput, simple and low-cost microfluidic method for quantitatively measuring the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss) modulus of individual cells. Cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and are pumped with high pressure through a 5.8 cm long and 200 \textmu m wide microfluidic channel. The fluid shear stress induces large, near ellipsoidal cell deformations. In addition, the flow profile in the channel causes the cells to rotate in a tank-treading manner. From the cell deformation and tank treading frequency, we extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic cell properties based on a theoretical framework developed by R. Roscoe1 that describes the deformation of a viscoelastic sphere in a viscous fluid under steady laminar flow. We confirm the accuracy of the method using atomic force microscopy-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. Our measurements demonstrate that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks.},

Yet, epithelial tissues bend and fold to shape organs in three dimensions. In this context, epithelial cells are too often simplified as prismatic blocks with a limited plasticity. However, there is increasing evidence that a realistic approach, even from a reductionist perspective, must include apico-basal intercalations (i.e. scutoidal cell shapes) for explaining epithelial organization convincingly. Here, we present an historical perspective about the tissue organization problem.

A number of techniques are available to measure mechanical stress in living tissues at cellular and subcellular resolution. 2D techniques that map stress in cultured cell monolayers provide the highest resolution and accessibility, and include 2D traction force microscopy, micropillar arrays, monolayer stress microscopy and monolayer stretching between flexible cantilevers. Mapping stresses in tissues cultured in 3D can be achieved using 3D traction force microscopy and the microbulge test. Techniques for measuring stress in vivo include servo-null methods for measuring luminal pressure, deformable inclusions, F\"orster resonance energy transfer tension sensors, laser ablation and computational methods for force inference. Although these techniques are far from becoming everyday tools in biomedical laboratories, their rapid development is fostering key advances in our understanding of the role of mechanics in morphogenesis, homeostasis and disease.},

We begin to do this by suggesting elements for building Cell Regulatory Networks (CRNs). In the same manner that GRNs create schedules of gene expression that result in the emergence of cell fates over time, CRNs create tissues and organs i.e. space. We also suggest how GRNs and CRNs might interact in the building of embryos through feedback loops involving mechanics and tissue tectonics.},

Both processes are driven by coordinating cellular forces and shapes at the tissue scale, but general principles governing this interplay remain to be discovered. Here we report that self-organization of myoblasts around integer topological defects, namely spirals and asters, suffices to establish complex multicellular architectures. In particular, these arrangements can trigger localized cell differentiation or, alternatively, when differentiation is inhibited, they can drive the growth of swirling protrusions. Both localized differentiation and growth of cellular vortices require specific stress patterns. By analysing the experimental velocity and orientational fields through active gel theory, we show that integer topological defects can generate force gradients that concentrate compressive stresses. We reveal these gradients by assessing spatial changes in nuclear volume and deformations of elastic pillars. We propose integer topological defects as mechanical organizing centres controlling differentiation and morphogenesis.},

Epithelial cells can change shape or intercalate as tissues deform during morphogenesis. We review the mechanical basis of tissue robustness and fluidity, with an emphasis on the pivotal role of junction dynamics. Tissue fluidity emerges from local active stresses acting at cell interfaces and allows the maintenance of epithelial organization during morphogenesis and tissue renewal.},

It is now established that approaches to engineer biological tissues must integrate and approximate the mechanics, both static and dynamic, of native tissues. Nevertheless, the literature on the mechanical properties of biological tissues differs greatly in methodology, and the available data are widely dispersed. This Review gathers together the most important data on the stiffness of living tissues and discusses the intricacies of tissue stiffness from a materials perspective, highlighting the main challenges associated with engineering lifelike tissues and proposing a unified view of this as yet unreported topic. Emerging advances that might pave the way for the next decade's take on bioengineered tissue stiffness are also presented, and differences and similarities between tissues in health and disease are discussed, along with various techniques for characterizing tissue stiffness at various dimensions from individual cells to organs.},

It remains unclear how contractile forces near the apical surface of a cell sheet drive out-of-the-plane bending of the sheet and whether myosin contractility is required throughout folding. By optogenetic-mediated acute inhibition of actomyosin, we find that during Drosophila mesoderm invagination, actomyosin contractility is critical to prevent tissue relaxation during the early, `priming' stage of folding but is dispensable for the actual folding step after the tissue passes through a stereotyped transitional configuration. This binary response suggests that Drosophila mesoderm is mechanically bistable during gastrulation. Computer modeling analysis demonstrates that the binary tissue response to actomyosin inhibition can be recapitulated in the simulated epithelium that undergoes buckling-like deformation jointly mediated by apical constriction in the mesoderm and in-plane compression generated by apicobasal shrinkage of the surrounding ectoderm. Interestingly, comparison between wild-type and snail mutants that fail to specify the mesoderm demonstrates that the lateral ectoderm undergoes apicobasal shrinkage during gastrulation independently of mesoderm invagination. We propose that Drosophila mesoderm invagination is achieved through an interplay between local apical constriction and mechanical bistability of the epithelium that facilitates epithelial buckling.},

Consistent with a requirement for this pathway, expression of dominant negative Gsk3{$\beta$} overcomes wnt5b knockdown. Immunostaining identifies focal adhesion kinase (Fak) as active in the MHB region, and knockdown demonstrates Fak is a regulator of basal constriction. Tissue specific knockdown further indicates that Fak functions cell autonomously within the MHBC. Fak acts downstream of wnt5b, suggesting that Wnt5b signals locally as an early step in basal constriction and acts together with more widespread Fak activation. This study delineates signaling pathways that regulate basal constriction during brain morphogenesis.},

We find that elongating follicles undergo repeated rounds of circumferential rotation around their long axes. Follicle epithelia mutant for integrin or collagen IV fail to rotate and elongate, which results in round eggs. We present evidence that polarized rotation is required to build a polarized, fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) that constrains tissue shape. Thus, global tissue rotation is a morphogenetic behavior that uses planar polarity information in the ECM to control tissue elongation.},

  abstract = {One-cell-thick monolayers are the simplest tissues in multicellular organisms, yet they fulfill critical roles in development and normal physiology. In early development, embryonic morphogenesis results largely from monolayer rearrangement and deformation due to internally generated forces. Later, monolayers act as physical barriers separating the internal environment from the exterior and must withstand externally applied forces. Though resisting and generating mechanical forces is an essential part of monolayer function, simple experimental methods to characterize monolayer mechanical properties are lacking. Here, we describe a system for tensile testing of freely suspended cultured monolayers that enables the examination of their mechanical behavior at multi-, uni-, and subcellular scales. Using this system, we provide measurements of monolayer elasticity and show that this is two orders of magnitude larger than the elasticity of their isolated cellular components. Monolayers could withstand more than a doubling in length before failing through rupture of intercellular junctions. Measurement of stress at fracture enabled a first estimation of the average force needed to separate cells within truly mature monolayers, approximately ninefold larger than measured in pairs of isolated cells. As in single cells, monolayer mechanical properties were strongly dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, myosin, and intercellular adhesions interfacing adjacent cells. High magnification imaging revealed that keratin filaments became progressively stretched during extension, suggesting they participate in monolayer mechanics. This multiscale study of monolayer response to deformation enabled by our device provides the first quantitative investigation of the link between monolayer biology and mechanics.},

Here, we find that, while expanding with an edge speed independent of initial conditions, millimeter-scale epithelial monolayers exhibit internal patterns of proliferation and migration that depend not on the current but on the initial tissue size, indicating memory effects. Specifically, the core of large tissues becomes very dense, almost quiescent, and ceases cell-cycle progression. In contrast, initially-smaller tissues develop a local minimum of cell density and a tissue-spanning vortex. To explain vortex formation, we propose an active polar fluid model with a feedback between cell polarization and tissue flow. Taken together, our findings suggest that expanding epithelia decouple their internal and edge regions, which enables robust expansion dynamics despite the presence of size- and history-dependent patterns in the tissue interior.},

It is now well established that diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) may be used to measure this fiber orientation at high spatial resolution. Cardiac fibers are also known to be organized in sheets with surface orientation varying throughout the ventricles. This article reviews results on use of DTMRI for measuring ventricular fiber orientation, as well as presents new results providing strong evidence that the tertiary eigenvector of the diffusion tensor is aligned locally with the cardiac sheet surface normal. Considered together, these data indicate that DTMRI may be used to reconstruct both ventricular fiber and sheet organization. This article also presents the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithm and shows that this algorithm may be used to bring ensembles of imaged and reconstructed hearts into correspondence (e.g., registration) so that variability of ventricular geometry, fiber, and sheet orientation may be quantified. Ventricular geometry and fiber structure is known to be remodeled in a range of disease processes; however, descriptions of this remodeling have remained subjective and qualitative. We anticipate that use of DTMRI for reconstruction of ventricular anatomy coupled with application of the LDDMM method for image volume registration will enable the detection and quantification of changes in cardiac anatomy that are characteristic of specific disease processes in the heart. Finally, we show that epicardial electrical mapping and DTMRI imaging may be performed in the same hearts. The anatomic data may then be used to simulate electrical conduction in a computational model of the very same heart that was mapped electrically. This facilitates direct comparison and testing of model versus experimental results and opens the door to quantitative measurement, modeling, and analysis of the ways in which remodeling of ventricular microanatomy influences electrical conduction in the heart.},

Despite considerable success in culturing physiologically relevant organoids, challenges remain to achieve real-life applications. In particular, the high variability of self-organizing growth and restricted experimental and analytical access hamper the translatability of organoid systems. In this Review, we argue that many limitations of traditional organoid culture can be addressed by engineering approaches at all levels of organoid systems. We investigate cell surface and genetic engineering approaches, and discuss stem cell niche engineering based on the design of matrices that allow spatiotemporal control of organoid growth and shape-guided morphogenesis. We examine how microfluidic approaches and lessons learnt from organs-on-a-chip enable the integration of mechano-physiological parameters and increase accessibility of organoids to improve functional readouts. Applying engineering principles to organoids increases reproducibility and provides experimental control, which will, ultimately, be required to enable clinical translation.},

Here, we provide a quantitative explanation for this phenomenon, rooted in the buckling theory of deformable active polar liquid crystals. Using a combination of linear stability analysis and computational fluid dynamics, we demonstrate that active layers, such as confined cell monolayers, are unstable to the formation of protrusions in the presence of disclinations. The instability originates from an interplay between the focusing of the elastic forces, mediated by defects, and the renormalization of the system's surface tension by the active flow. The posttransitional regime is also characterized by several complex morphodynamical processes, such as oscillatory deformations, droplet nucleation, and active turbulence. Our findings offer an explanation of recent observations on tissue morphogenesis and shed light on the dynamics of active surfaces in general.},

Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are: * an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index * useful examples and exercises for the student * selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics. Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

  abstract = {Collagen fibres within fibrous soft biological tissues such as artery walls, cartilage, myocardiums, corneas and heart valves are responsible for their anisotropic mechanical behaviour. It has recently been recognized that the dispersed orientation of these fibres has a significant effect on the mechanical response of the tissues. Modelling of the dispersed structure is important for the prediction of the stress and deformation characteristics in (patho)physiological tissues under various loading conditions. This paper provides a timely and critical review of the continuum modelling of fibre dispersion, specifically, the angular integration and the generalized structure tensor models. The models are used in representative numerical examples to fit sets of experimental data that have been obtained from mechanical tests and fibre structural information from second-harmonic imaging. In particular, patches of healthy and diseased aortic tissues are investigated, and it is shown that the predictions of the models fit very well with the data. It is straightforward to use the models described herein within a finite-element framework, which will enable more realistic (and clinically relevant) boundary-value problems to be solved. This also provides a basis for further developments of material models and points to the need for additional mechanical and microstructural data that can inform further advances in the material modelling.},

  abstract = {Embryonic morphogenesis relies on the intrinsic ability of cells, often through remodeling the cytoskeleton, to shape epithelial tissues during development. Epithelial invagination is an example of morphogenesis that depends on this remodeling but the cellular mechanisms driving arrangement of cytoskeletal elements needed for tissue deformation remain incompletely characterized. To elucidate these mechanisms, live fluorescent microscopy and immunohistochemistry on fixed specimens were performed on chick and mouse lens placodes. This analysis revealed the formation of peripherally localized, circumferentially orientated and aligned junctions enriched in F-actin and MyoIIB. Once formed, the aligned junctions contract in a Rho-kinase and non-muscle myosin dependent manner. Further molecular characterization of these junctions revealed a Rho-kinase dependent accumulation of Arhgef11, a RhoA-specific guanine exchange factor known to regulate the formation of actomyosin cables and junctional contraction. In contrast, the localization of the Par-complex protein Par3, was reduced in these circumferentially orientated junctions. In an effort to determine if Par3 plays a negative role in MyoIIB accumulation, Par3-deficient mouse embryos were analyzed which not only revealed an increase in bicellular junctional accumulation of MyoIIB, but also a reduction of Arhgef11. Together, these results highlight the importance of the formation of the multicellular actomyosin cables that appear essential to the initiation of epithelial invagination and implicate the potential role of Arhgef11 and Par3 in their contraction and formation.},

Mechanical strain also enhances epithelial and endothelial uptake of nanoparticulates and stimulates their transport into the underlying microvascular channel. Similar effects of physiological breathing on nanoparticle absorption are observed in whole mouse lung. Mechanically active ``organ-on-a-chip'' microdevices that reconstitute tissue-tissue interfaces critical to organ function may therefore expand the capabilities of cell culture models and provide low-cost alternatives to animal and clinical studies for drug screening and toxicology applications.},

The cancer 3-D culture methods aim to preserve the biological characteristics of original tumors better than conventional 2-D monolayer cultures, and include tumor-derived organoids, tumor-derived spheroids, organotypic multicellular spheroids, and multicellular tumor spheroids. The 3-D culture methods differ in terms of cancer cell sources, protocols for cell handling, and the required time intervals. Tumor-derived spheroids are unique because they are purposed for the enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cells with stem cell-related characteristics. These spheroids are grown as floating spheres and have been used as surrogate systems to evaluate the CSC-related characteristics of solid tumors in vitro. Because eradication of CSCs is likely to be of clinical importance due to their association with the malignant nature of cancer cells, such as tumorigenicity or chemoresistance, the investigation of tumor-derived spheroids may provide invaluable clues to fight against cancer. Spheroid cultures have been established from cancers including glioma, breast, colon, ovary, and prostate cancers, and their biological and biochemical characteristics have been investigated by many research groups. In addition to the investigation of CSCs, tumor-derived spheroids may prove to be instrumental for a high-throughput screening platform or for the cultivation of CSC-related tumor cells found in the circulation or body fluids.},

The modular nature of such processes suggests that it should be possible to isolate individual modules, determine the minimum set of requirements sufficient to drive tissue remodeling, and re-construct morphogenesis. Here we use optogenetics to reconstitute epithelial folding in embryonic Drosophila tissues that otherwise would not undergo invagination. We show that precise spatial and temporal activation of Rho signaling is sufficient to trigger apical constriction and tissue folding. Induced furrows can occur at any position along the dorsal\textendash ventral or anterior\textendash posterior embryo axis in response to the spatial pattern and level of optogenetic activation. Thus, epithelial folding is a direct function of the spatio-temporal organization and strength of Rho signaling that on its own is sufficient to drive tissue internalization independently of any pre-determined condition or differentiation program associated with endogenous invagination processes.},

In fibroblasts plated onto islands of optimal size, an initially circular actin pattern evolves into a radial pattern of actin bundles that undergo asymmetric chiral swirling before finally producing parallel linear stress fibers. Epitheliocytes, however, did not exhibit succession through all the actin patterns described above. Upon confinement, the actin cytoskeleton in non-keratinocyte epitheliocytes was arrested at the circular stage, while in keratinocytes it progressed as far as the radial pattern but still could not break symmetry. Epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition pushed actin cytoskeleton development from circular towards radial patterns but remained insufficient to cause chirality. Knockout of cytokeratins also did not promote actin chirality development in keratinocytes. Left\textendash right asymmetric cytoskeleton swirling could, however, be induced in keratinocytes by treatment with small doses of the G-actin sequestering drug, latrunculin A in a transcription-independent manner. Both the nucleus and the cytokeratin network followed the induced chiral swirling.

Polarized membrane transport has emerged as a key driver not only for establishing individual epithelial cell polarity, but also for coordination of epithelial polarization during apical lumen formation and tissue morphogenesis. In recent years, much work has been dedicated to identifying membrane trafficking regulators required for lumenogenesis. In this review we will summarize the findings from the past couple of decades in defining the molecular machinery governing lumenogenesis both in 3D tissue culture models and during organ development in vivo.},

Polymer gel models suggest that wrinkling emerges spontaneously due to compression forces arising during differential swelling, but these ideas have not been tested in a living system. Here, we report the appearance of surface wrinkles during the in vitro development and self-organization of human brain organoids in a microfabricated compartment that supports in situ imaging over a timescale of weeks. We observe the emergence of convolutions at a critical cell density and maximal nuclear strain, which are indicative of a mechanical instability. We identify two opposing forces contributing to differential growth: cytoskeletal contraction at the organoid core and cell-cycle-dependent nuclear expansion at the organoid perimeter. The wrinkling wavelength exhibits linear scaling with tissue thickness, consistent with balanced bending and stretching energies. Lissencephalic (smooth brain) organoids display reduced convolutions, modified scaling and a reduced elastic modulus. Although the mechanism here does not include the neuronal migration seen in vivo, it models the physics of the folding brain remarkably well. Our on-chip approach offers a means for studying the emergent properties of organoid development, with implications for the embryonic human brain.},

Three-dimensional stem-cell cultures have provided insights into human cell differentiation3,4. However, current approaches use scaffold-free stem-cell aggregates, which develop non-reproducible tissue shapes and variable cell-fate patterns. This limits their capacity to recapitulate organ formation. Here we present a chip-based culture system that enables self-organization of micropatterned stem cells into precise three-dimensional cell-fate patterns and organ shapes. We use this system to recreate neural tube folding from human stem cells in a dish. Upon neural induction5,6, neural ectoderm folds into a millimetre-long neural tube covered with non-neural ectoderm. Folding occurs at 90\% fidelity, and anatomically resembles the developing human neural tube. We find that neural and non-neural ectoderm are necessary and sufficient for folding morphogenesis. We identify two mechanisms drive folding: (1) apical contraction of neural ectoderm, and (2) basal adhesion mediated via extracellular matrix synthesis by non-neural ectoderm. Targeting these two mechanisms using drugs leads to morphological defects similar to neural tube defects. Finally, we show that neural tissue width determines neural tube shape, suggesting that morphology along the anterior\textendash posterior axis depends on neural ectoderm geometry in addition to molecular gradients7. Our approach provides a~new route to the study of human organ morphogenesis in health and disease.},

As part of their function, they must withstand extrinsic mechanical stresses applied at high strain rates. However, little is known about how monolayers respond to mechanical deformations. Here, by subjecting suspended epithelial monolayers to stretch, we find that they dissipate stresses on a minute timescale and that relaxation can be described by a power law with an exponential cut-off at timescales larger than about 10\,s. This process involves an increase in monolayer length, pointing to active remodelling of cellular biopolymers at the molecular scale during relaxation. Strikingly, monolayers consisting of tens of thousands of cells relax stress with similar dynamics to single rounded cells, and both respond similarly to perturbations of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. By contrast, cell\textendash cell junctional complexes and intermediate filaments do not relax tissue stress, but form stable connections between cells, allowing monolayers to behave rheologically as single cells. Taken together, our data show that actomyosin dynamics governs the rheological properties of epithelial monolayers, dissipating applied stresses and enabling changes in monolayer length.},

How the interplay of local differential tensions with tissue geometry and with external forces results in tissue-scale morphogenesis remains an open question. Here, we describe epithelial sheets as active viscoelastic surfaces and study their deformation under patterned internal tensions and bending moments. In addition to isotropic effects, we take into account nematic alignment in the plane of the tissue, which gives rise to shape-dependent, anisotropic active tensions and bending moments. We present phase diagrams of the mechanical equilibrium shapes of pre-patterned closed shells and explore their dynamical deformations. Our results show that a combination of nematic alignment and gradients in internal tensions and bending moments is sufficient to reproduce basic building blocks of epithelial morphogenesis, including fold formation, budding, neck formation, flattening, and tubulation.},

In particular, magnetic fields offer a safe and effective manipulation method for biomedical applications, which typically require remote actuation in enclosed and confined spaces8\textendash 10. With advances in magnetic field control11, magnetically responsive soft materials have also evolved from embedding discrete magnets12or incorporating magnetic particles13into soft compounds to generating nonuniform magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets14,15.

Our approach is based on direct ink writing16of an elastomer composite containing ferromagnetic microparticles. By applying a magnetic field to the dispensing nozzle while printing17, we reorient particles along the applied field to impart patterned magnetic polarity to printed filaments. This method allows us to program ferromagnetic domains in complex 3D-printed soft materials, enabling a set of previously inaccessible modes of transformation, such as remotely controlled auxetic behaviours of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios. The actuation speed and power density of our printed soft materials with programmed ferromagnetic domains are orders of magnitude greater than existing 3D-printed active materials. We further demonstrate diverse functions derived from complex shape changes, including reconfigurable soft electronics, a mechanical metamaterial that can jump and a soft robot that crawls, rolls, catches fast-moving objects and transports a pharmaceutical dose.},

When maintained at high cell density, tubule-forming clones displayed large numbers of anastomosing tubules which contained lumens. The frequency of observation of the tubule-forming clones in an MDCK population was 0.7\%. Tubule-formingMDCK clones should be useful in studying tubule morphogenesis. While agents that affect protein kinase A activity increased dome formation, the same agents abolished the formationof tubules in all tubule-forming clones.In contrast, drugs that stimulate protein kinase C activity (phorbolesters and staurosporine)decreased dome formation and increased tubule morphogenesis in all MDCK morphotypes.Tubule-formingclones were found to have lower resting levels of cyclic-AMPand to respond to forskolin stimulation of adenylate cyclase less readily. Hence, signals transmitted by the protein kinase C pathway appear to lead to tubule formation in MDCK cells, while signals transmitted through the protein kinase A pathway lead to dome formation.

Passive mechanical forces are the product of in situ mechanical instabilities that trigger out-of-plane buckling and clefting deformations of adjacent tissues. Many of the molecular and physical signals that underlie buckling and clefting morphogenesis remain unclear and require new experimental strategies to be uncovered.

However, the search to emulate phenomena observed in the living matter has fallen short of producing a cytoskeletal network that would be structurally stable yet possessing adaptive plasticity. Here, we address this challenge by combining cytoskeletal polymers in a composite, where self-assembling microtubules and actin filaments collectively self-organise due to the activity of microtubules-percolating molecular motors. We demonstrate that microtubules spatially organise actin filaments that in turn guide microtubules. The two networks align in an ordered fashion using this feedback loop. In this composite, actin filaments can act as structural memory and, depending on the concentration of the components, microtubules either write this memory or get guided by it. The system is sensitive to external stimuli suggesting possible autoregulatory behaviour in changing mechanochemical environment. We thus establish artificial active actin-microtubule composite as a system demonstrating architectural stability and plasticity.},

  abstract = {Wood boring is a feature of several insect species and is a major cause of severe and irreparable damage to trees. Adult females typically deposit their eggs on the stem surface under bark scales. The emerging hatchlings live within wood during their larval phase, avoiding possible predation, whilst continually boring and tunneling through wood until pupation. A study of wood boring by insects offers unique insights into the bioengineering principles that drive evolutionary adaptations. We show that larval mandibles of the coffee wood stem borer beetle (Xylotrechus quadripes: Cerambycidae) have a highly sharp cusp edge to initiate fractures in Arabica wood and a suitable shape to generate small wood chips that are suitable for digestion. Cuticle hardness at the tip is significantly enhanced through zinc-enrichment. A hollow architecture significantly reduces bending stresses at the mandibular base without compromising the structural integrity. Finite element model of the mandible showed highest stresses in the tip region; these decreased to significantly lower values at the start of the hollow section. A scaling model based on a fracture mechanics framework shows the importance of the mandible shape in generating optimal chip sizes. These findings contain general principles in tool design and put in focus interactions of insects and their woody hosts.},

  abstract = {Global changes of cell shape under mechanical or osmotic external stresses are mostly controlled by the mechanics of the cortical actin cytoskeleton underlying the cell membrane. Some aspects of this process can be recapitulated in vitro on reconstituted actin-and-membrane systems. In this paper, we investigate how the mechanical properties of a branched actin network shell, polymerized at the surface of a liposome, control membrane shape when the volume is reduced. We observe a variety of membrane shapes depending on the actin thickness. Thin shells undergo buckling, characterized by a cup-shape deformation of the membrane that coincides with the one of the actin network. Thick shells produce membrane wrinkles, but do not deform their outer layer. For intermediate micrometer-thick shells, wrinkling of the membrane is observed, and the actin layer is slightly deformed. Confronting our experimental results with a theoretical description, we determine the transition between buckling and wrinkling, which depends on the thickness of the actin shell and the size of the liposome. We thus unveil the generic mechanism by which biomembranes are able to accommodate their shape against mechanical compression, through thickness adaptation of their cortical cytoskeleton.},

How these sheets develop and withstand three-dimensional deformations has remained unclear. Here we combine measurements of epithelial tension and shape with theoretical modelling to show that epithelial sheets are active superelastic materials. We produce arrays of epithelial domes with controlled geometry. Quantification of luminal pressure and epithelial tension reveals a tensional plateau over several-fold areal strains. These extreme strains in the~tissue are accommodated by highly heterogeneous strains at a cellular level, in seeming contradiction to the measured tensional uniformity. This phenomenon is reminiscent of superelasticity, a behaviour that is generally attributed to microscopic material instabilities in metal alloys. We show that in epithelial cells this instability is triggered by a stretch-induced dilution of the actin cortex, and is rescued by the intermediate filament network. Our study reveals a type of mechanical behaviour\textemdash which we term active superelasticity\textemdash that enables epithelial sheets to sustain extreme stretching under constant tension.},

After EMT, cells acquire an elongated morphology with front/back polarity, which can be attributed to actin-driven protrusion formation as well as the gain of vimentin expression. Consequently, cells can deform and remodel the surrounding matrix in order to facilitate local invasion. In this review, we highlight recent bioengineering~approaches to elucidate EMT and functional changes in the cytoskeleton. First, we review transitions between multicellular clusters and dispersed individuals on planar surfaces, which often exhibit coordinated behaviors driven by leader cells and EMT. Second, we consider the functional role of vimentin, which can be probed at subcellular length scales and within confined spaces. Third, we discuss the role of topographical patterning and EMT via a contact guidance like mechanism. Finally, we address how multicellular clusters disorganize and disseminate in 3D matrix. These new technologies enable controlled physical microenvironments and higher-resolution spatiotemporal measurements of EMT at the single cell level. In closing, we consider future directions for the field and outstanding questions regarding EMT and the cytoskeleton for human cancer progression.},

Powerful new tools for genetic, biophysical and optogenetic manipulation are allowing us to perturb the underlying machinery that generates these patterns in increasingly sophisticated ways. Rapid advances in theory and computing have made it possible to construct predictive models that describe how cell and tissue organization and dynamics emerge from the local coupling of biochemistry and mechanics. Together, these advances have opened up a wealth of new opportunities to explore how mechanochemical patterning shapes organismal development. In this roadmap, we present a series of forward-looking case studies on mechanochemical patterning in development, written by scientists working at the interface between the physical and biological sciences, and covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, organisms, and modes of development. Together, these contributions highlight the many ways in which the dynamic coupling of mechanics and biochemistry shapes biological dynamics: from mechanoenzymes that sense force to tune their activity and motor output, to collectives of cells in tissues that flow and redistribute biochemical signals during development.},

These phases result from the interactions between the microscopic constituent components - the cells - that manifest in macroscopic properties such as fluidity, rigidity and resistance to changes in shape and volume. Looked at from such a perspective, phase transitions from a rigid to a flowing state or vice versa define much of what happens in many biological processes especially during early development and diseases such as cancer. Additionally, collectively moving confluent cells can also lead to kinematic phase transitions in biological systems similar to multi-particle systems where the particles can interact and show sub-populations characterised by specific velocities. In this Perspective we discuss the similarities and limitations of the analogy between biological and inert physical systems both from theoretical perspective as well as experimental evidence in biological systems. In understanding such transitions, it is crucial to acknowledge that the macroscopic properties of biological materials and their modifications result from the complex interplay between the microscopic properties of cells including growth or death, neighbour interactions and secretion of matrix, phenomena unique to biological systems. Detecting phase transitions in vivo is technically difficult. We present emerging approaches that address this challenge and may guide our understanding of the organization and macroscopic behaviour of biological tissues.},

Addition of ouabain caused collapse of domes, suggesting that transport functions were required for maintenance of domes. Dome formation in both epithelial cell lines was stimulated by a broad spectrum of known inducers of erythroid differentiation in Friend erythroleukemia cells. Among these inducers were: (1) polar solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and hexamethylene bisacetamide; (2) purines such as hypoxanthine, inosine, and adenosine; (3) low-molecular-weight fatty acids such as n-butyrate; and (4) conditions expected to elevate levels of cyclic AMP. In the latter group were activators of adenylate cyclase such as cholera toxin and prostaglandin E1; cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine; and analogs of cyclic AMP. Induction of domes occurred 15\textendash 30 h after addition of inducer to the culture medium. Induction by chemicals was serum-dependent and required protein synthesis but not DNA synthesis. Induced dome formation was reversible after removal of inducer, requiring the contiuous presence of inducer. Reversal was also observed after either removal of serum or addition of inhibitors of protein synthesis. These results suggest the hypothesis that domes arise in these epithelial cultures by a process that is similar to cell differentiation and is influenced by cyclic AMP.},

Emerging evidence suggests that the desmosomal adhesion protein Desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) functions beyond the desmosomal adhesion and plays a role in regulating the fundamental pathways that govern cell fate decisions in response to environmental chemical and mechanical stresses. In this study, we explored the role of Dsg3 on dome formation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in MDCK cells, a kidney epithelial cell model widely used to study cell differentiation and tight junction formation and integrity. We show that overexpression of Dsg3 constrained nuclear ROS production and cellular doming in confluent cell cultures and these features coincided with augmented TER and enhanced tight junction integrity. Conversely, cells expressing dominant-negative Dsg3{$\Delta$}C mutants exhibited heightened ROS production and accelerated doming, accompanied by increased apoptosis, as well as cell proliferation, with massive disruption in F-actin organization and accumulation, and alterations in tight junctions. Inhibition of actin polymerization and protein synthesis was able to sufficiently block dome formation in mutant populations. Taken together, these findings underscore that Dsg3 has a role in controlling cellular viability and differentiation as well as the functional integrity of tight junctions in MDCK cells.},

To understand the origin of these morphologies, we dissect leaves and differentially stretch foam ribbons to show that these shapes arise from a simple cause, the elastic relaxation via bending that follows either differential growth (in leaves) or differential stretching past the yield point (in ribbons). We quantify these different modalities in terms of a mathematical model for the shape of an initially flat elastic sheet with lateral gradients in longitudinal growth. By using a combination of scaling concepts, stability analysis, and numerical simulations, we map out the shape space for these growing ribbons and find that as the relative growth strain is increased, a long flat lamina deforms to a saddle shape and/or develops undulations that may lead to strongly localized ripples as the growth strain is localized to the edge of the leaf. Our theory delineates the geometric and growth control parameters that determine the shape space of finite laminae and thus allows for a comparative study of elongated leaf morphology.},

  abstract = {The direction in which a cell divides is set by the orientation of its mitotic spindle and is important for determining cell fate, controlling tissue shape and maintaining tissue architecture. Division perpendicular to the plane of the substrate can promote tissue stratification during development or wound healing, but also metastasis when orientation is aberrant. Much is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in setting the spindle orientation. However, less is known about the contribution of mechanical factors, such as tissue tension, in ensuring spindle orientation in the plane of the epithelium, despite epithelia being continuously subjected to mechanical stresses. Here, we used suspended epithelial monolayers devoid of extracellular matrix and subjected to varying levels of tissue tension to study the orientation of division relative to the tissue plane. We found that decreasing tissue tension by compressing the monolayers or by inhibiting myosin contractility leads to a higher frequency of out-of-plane divisions. Reciprocally, accurate in-plane division can be restored by increasing tissue tension by increasing cell contractility or by tissue stretching. By considering the full three-dimensional geometry of the epithelium, we show that spindles are sensitive to tissue tension, independently of cell shape, through its impact on the tension at subcellular surfaces. Overall, our data suggest that accurate spindle orientation in the plane of the epithelium necessitates the presence of a sufficiently large tension at intercellular junctions. Significance statement In growing epithelia, divisions are typically oriented in the plane of the tissue to drive expansion. In some organs, divisions are then re-oriented so that they occur perpendicular to the epithelium plane to drive tissue stratification and cell differentiation. When uncontrolled, this switch in orientation can lead to defects in tissue organisation and, in cancer, likely contribute to metastasis. While much is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling mitotic spindle orientation, less is known about the role of mechanical factors. Here we use mechanical and chemical perturbations to show that mechanics plays a role in controlling the plane of division. Overall, our data suggest that the orientation of spindles in the epithelium plane requires sufficient tension across intercellular junctions.},

Whether individual cells can tailor their behavior to the limited                         space remains unclear.

Here we study epithelial cell monolayers on corrugated hydrogels engineered into wavy patterns, examining how concave and convex curvatures affect cellular and nuclear shape. We find that substrate curvature affects monolayer thickness, which is larger in valleys than crests. We show that this feature generically arises in a vertex model, leading to the hypothesis that cells may sense curvature by modifying the thickness of the tissue. We find that local curvature also affects nuclear morphology and positioning, which we explain by extending the vertex model to take into account membrane\textendash nucleus interactions, encoding thickness modulation in changes to nuclear deformation and position. We propose that curvature governs the spatial distribution of yes-associated proteins via nuclear shape and density changes. We show that curvature also induces significant variations in lamins, chromatin condensation and cell proliferation rate in folded epithelial tissues. Together, this work identifies active cell mechanics and nuclear mechanoadaptation as the key players of the mechanistic regulation of epithelia to substrate curvature.},

  abstract = {Frederik Ruysch, working in the Netherlands, introduced the term epithelia in the third volume of his Thesaurus Anatomicus in 1703. Ruysch created the term from the Greek epi, which means on top of, and thele, which means nipple, to describe the type of tissue he found when dissecting the lip of a cadaver. In the mid nineteenth century, anatomist Albrecht von Haller adopted the word epithelium, designating Ruysch's original terminology as the plural version. In modern science, epithelium is a type of animal tissue in which cells are packed into neatly arranged sheets. The epithelial cells lie proximate to each other and attach to a thin, fibrous sheet called a basement membrane. Epithelia line the surfaces of cavities and structures throughout the body, and also form glands.  Although they lack blood vessels, epithelia contain nerves and can function to receive sensation, absorb, protect, and secrete, depending on which part of the body the epithelia line. During development, epithelia act in conjunction with another tissue type, mesenchyme, to form nearly every organ in the body, from hair and teeth to the digestive tract. Epithelia are an essential part of embryonic development and the maintenance and function of the body throughout life.},

In this study, we encapsulated two epithelial cell lines, MDCK and J3B1A, into hollow alginate tubes and grew them under cylindrical confinement forming a complete monolayer. MDCK monolayers detached from the alginate shell at a constant rate, whereas J3B1A monolayers detached at a low rate unless the tube radius was reduced. We showed that this detachment is driven by contractile stresses in the epithelium and can be enhanced by local curvature. This allows us to conclude that J3B1A cells exhibit smaller contractility than MDCK cells. Monolayers inside curved tubes detach at a higher rate on the outside of a curve, confirming that detachment is driven by contraction.},

Microfabrication, finite element modelling, light-sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation are used to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape-programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. The robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues is demonstrated by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of molded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.},

Recent advances have provided new insights into the extracellular signals and intracellular mediators of tight junction regulation in disease states as well as into the interactions of intestinal barrier function with mucosal immune cells and luminal microbiota.

  abstract = {The function of organs such as lungs, kidneys and mammary glands relies on the three-dimensional geometry of their epithelium. To adopt shapes such as spheres, tubes and ellipsoids, epithelia generate mechanical stresses that are generally unknown. Here we engineered curved epithelial monolayers of controlled size and shape and mapped their state of stress. We designed pressurized epithelia with circular, rectangular and ellipsoidal footprints. We developed a computational method to map the stress tensor in these epithelia. This method establishes a direct correspondence between epithelial shape and mechanical stress without assumptions of material properties. In epithelia with spherical geometry spanning more than one order of magnitude in radius, we show that stress weakly increases with areal strain in a size-independent manner. In epithelia with rectangular and ellipsoidal cross-section we found pronounced stress anisotropies consistent with the asymmetric distribution of tractions measured at the cell-substrate contact line. In these anisotropic profiles, cell shape tended to align with the direction of maximum principal stress but this alignment was non-universal and depended on epithelial geometry. Besides interrogating the fundamental mechanics of epithelia over a broad range of sizes and shapes, our approach will enable a systematic study of how geometry and stress influence epithelial fate and function in three-dimensions.},

Here we show that the nematic order of the supracellular actin fibres in regenerating Hydra defines a slowly varying field, whose dynamics provide an effective description of the morphogenesis process. We show that topological defects in this field, which are long-lived yet display rich dynamics, act as organization centres with morphological features developing at defect sites. These observations suggest that the nematic orientation field can be considered a `mechanical morphogen' whose dynamics, in conjugation with various biochemical and mechanical signalling processes, result in the robust emergence of functional patterns during morphogenesis.},

Gastrulation in the Drosophila embryo involves the apical constriction of ventral cells, which induces a ventral furrow and invagination of the mesoderm. This new work shows that the apical constriction of ventral cells is pulsed: repeated constrictions are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cells in maintained. These pulses are powered by actin\textendash myosin contractions and are dependent on the expression of a transcription factor Snail, whereas the constricted state is stabilized by another transcription factor, Twist.},

  abstract = {A critical juncture in early development is the partitioning of cells that will adopt different fates into three germ layers: the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm. This step is achieved through the internalization of specified cells from the outermost surface layer, through a process called gastrulation. In Drosophila, gastrulation is achieved through cell shape changes (i.e., apical constriction) that change tissue curvature and lead to the folding of a surface epithelium. Folding of embryonic tissue results in mesoderm and endoderm invagination, not as individual cells, but as collective tissue units. The tractability of Drosophila as a model system is best exemplified by how much we know about Drosophila gastrulation, from the signals that pattern the embryo to the molecular components that generate force, and how these components are organized to promote cell and tissue shape changes. For mesoderm invagination, graded signaling by the morphogen, Sp\"atzle, sets up a gradient in transcriptional activity that leads to the expression of a secreted ligand (Folded gastrulation) and a transmembrane protein (T48). Together with the GPCR Mist, which is expressed in the mesoderm, and the GPCR Smog, which is expressed uniformly, these signals activate heterotrimeric G-protein and small Rho-family G-protein signaling to promote apical contractility and changes in cell and tissue shape. A notable feature of this signaling pathway is its intricate organization in both space and time. At the cellular level, signaling components and the cytoskeleton exhibit striking polarity, not only along the apical\textendash basal cell axis, but also within the apical domain. Furthermore, gene expression controls a highly choreographed chain of events, the dynamics of which are critical for primordium invagination; it does not simply throw the cytoskeletal ``on'' switch. Finally, studies of Drosophila gastrulation have provided insight into how global tissue mechanics and movements are intertwined as multiple tissues simultaneously change shape. Overall, these studies have contributed to the view that cells respond to forces that propagate over great distances, demonstrating that cellular decisions, and, ultimately, tissue shape changes, proceed by integrating cues across an entire embryo.},

Activation of OptoShroom3 through illumination in an epithelial Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell sheet reduces the apical surface of the stimulated cells and causes displacements in the adjacent regions. Light-induced apical constriction provokes the folding of epithelial cell colonies on soft gels. Its application to murine and human neural organoids leads to thickening of neuroepithelia, apical lumen reduction in optic vesicles, and flattening in neuroectodermal tissues. These results show that spatiotemporal control of apical constriction can trigger several types of 3D deformation depending on the initial tissue context.},

  abstract = {Since protein patterning on 2D surfaces has emerged as an important tool in cell biology, the development of easy patterning methods has gained importance in biology labs. In this paper we present a simple, rapid and reliable technique to fabricate thin layers of UV curable polymer with through holes. These membranes are as easy to fabricate as microcontact printing stamps and can be readily used for stencil patterning. We show how this microfabrication scheme allows highly reproducible and highly homogeneous protein patterning with micron sized resolution on surfaces as large as 10 cm2. Using these stencils, fragile proteins were patterned without loss of function in a fully hydrated state. We further demonstrate how intricate patterns of multiple proteins can be achieved by stacking the stencil membranes. We termed this approach microserigraphy.},

There is growing evidence for the importance of cross talk between these two adhesion types, yet little is known about the impact of these interactions on the mechanical coupling of cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we combine experiment and theory to reveal how intercellular adhesions modulate forces transmitted to the ECM. In the absence of cadherin-based adhesions, primary mouse keratinocytes within a colony appear to act independently, with significant traction forces extending throughout the colony. In contrast, with strong cadherin-based adhesions, keratinocytes in a cohesive colony localize traction forces to the colony periphery. Through genetic or antibody-mediated loss of cadherin expression or function, we show that cadherin-based adhesions are essential for this mechanical cooperativity. A minimal physical model in which cell\textendash cell adhesions modulate the physical cohesion between contractile cells is sufficient to recreate the spatial rearrangement of traction forces observed experimentally with varying strength of cadherin-based adhesions. This work defines the importance of cadherin-based cell\textendash cell adhesions in coordinating mechanical activity of epithelial cells and has implications for the mechanical regulation of epithelial tissues during development, homeostasis, and disease.},

Although the application of external loading or biochemical treatments allows to estimate these properties globally, it remains problematic to assess how such external stimuli compare with internal, cell-generated contractions. Here we engineered 3D microtissues composed of optogenetically-modified fibroblasts encapsulated within collagen. Using light to control the activity of RhoA, a major regulator of cellular contractility, we induced local mechanical perturbation within 3D fibrous microtissues, while tracking in real time microtissue stress and strain. We thus investigated the dynamic regulation of light-induced, local contractions and their spatio-temporal propagation in microtissues. By comparing the evolution of stresses and strains upon stimulation, we demonstrated the potential of our technique for quantifying tissue elasticity and viscosity, before examining the possibility of using light to map local anisotropies in mechanically heterogeneous microtissues. Altogether, our results open an avenue to non-destructively chart the rheology of 3D tissues in real time, using their own constituting cells as internal actuators.},

During tumorigenesis, transformed cells overproliferate and epithelial architecture is disrupted. However, the biophysical parameters that underlie the adoption of abnormal tumour tissue shapes are unknown. Here we show in the pancreas of mice that the morphology of epithelial tumours is determined by the interplay of cytoskeletal changes in transformed cells and the existing tubular geometry. To analyse the morphological changes in tissue architecture during the initiation of cancer, we developed a three-dimensional whole-organ imaging technique that enables tissue analysis at single-cell resolution. Oncogenic transformation of pancreatic ducts led to two types of neoplastic growth: exophytic lesions that expanded outwards from the duct and endophytic lesions that grew inwards to the ductal lumen. Myosin activity was higher apically than basally in wild-type cells, but upon transformation this gradient was lost in both lesion types. Three-dimensional vertex model simulations and a continuum theory of epithelial mechanics, which incorporate the cytoskeletal changes observed in transformed cells, indicated that the diameter of the source epithelium instructs the morphology of growing tumours. Three-dimensional imaging revealed that\textemdash consistent with theory predictions\textemdash small pancreatic ducts produced exophytic growth, whereas large ducts deformed endophytically. Similar patterns of lesion growth were observed in tubular epithelia of the liver and lung; this finding identifies tension imbalance and~tissue curvature as fundamental determinants of epithelial tumorigenesis.},

A wide range of computational and phenomenological models as well as experimental techniques have been proposed over the past two decades to describe the cytoskeleton, giving rise to several, often contradictory, theories for describing its rheology.

Disordered soft materials, such as foams, emulsions and colloidal suspensions, switch from fluid-like to solid-like behaviours at a jamming transition1\textendash 4. Similarly, cell collectives have been shown to display glassy dynamics in 2D and 3D5,6 and jamming in cultured epithelial monolayers7,8, behaviours recently predicted theoretically9\textendash 11 and proposed to influence asthma pathobiology8 and tumour progression12. However, little is known about whether these seemingly universal behaviours occur in vivo13 and, specifically, whether they play any functional part during embryonic morphogenesis. Here, by combining direct in vivo measurements of tissue mechanics with analysis of cellular dynamics, we show that during vertebrate body axis elongation, posterior tissues undergo a jamming transition from a fluid-like behaviour at the extending end, the mesodermal progenitor zone, to a solid-like behaviour in the presomitic mesoderm. We uncover an anteroposterior, N-cadherin-dependent gradient in yield stress that provides increasing mechanical integrity to the presomitic mesoderm, consistent with the tissue transiting from a wetter to a dryer foam-like architecture. Our results show that cell-scale stresses fluctuate rapidly (within about 1 min), enabling cell rearrangements and effectively `melting' the tissue at the growing end. Persistent (more than 0.5 h) stresses at supracellular scales, rather than cell-scale stresses, guide morphogenetic flows in fluid-like tissue regions. Unidirectional axis extension is sustained by the reported rigidification of the presomitic mesoderm, which mechanically supports posterior, fluid-like tissues during remodelling before their maturation. The spatiotemporal control of fluid-like and solid-like tissue states may represent a generic physical mechanism of embryonic morphogenesis.},

Here, we report the mechanics of the cellular microenvironment that cells probe in vivo and in situ during zebrafish presomitic mesoderm differentiation. By quantifying both endogenous cell-generated strains and tissue mechanics, we show that individual cells probe the stiffness associated with deformations of the supracellular, foam-like tissue architecture. Stress relaxation leads to a perceived microenvironment stiffness that decreases over time, with cells probing the softest regime. We find that most mechanical parameters, including those probed by cells, vary along the anteroposterior axis as mesodermal progenitors differentiate. These findings expand our understanding of in vivo mechanosensation and might aid the design of advanced scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.},

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit an intrinsic capacity for self-organization, which motivates their use as a tractable model of early human embryogenesis. We engineered patterned substrates that recapitulate the biophysical properties of the early embryo and mediate the self-organization of ``gastrulation-like'' nodes in cultured hESCs. Tissue geometries that generated local nodes of high cell-adhesion tension directed the spatial patterning of the BMP4-dependent ``gastrulation-like'' phenotype by enhancing phosphorylation and junctional release of {$\beta$}-catenin to promote Wnt signaling and mesoderm specification. Furthermore, direct force application via mechanical stretching promoted BMP-dependent mesoderm specification, confirming that tissue-level forces can directly regulate cell fate specification in early human development.},

Zebrafish semicircular canals form from invaginations in the otic epithelium (buds) that extend and fuse to form the hubs of each canal. We find that conventional actomyosin-driven behaviors are not required. Instead, local secretion of hyaluronan, made by the enzymes uridine 5{${'}$}-diphosphate dehydrogenase (ugdh) and hyaluronan synthase 3 (has3), drives canal morphogenesis. Charged hyaluronate polymers osmotically swell with water and generate isotropic extracellular pressure to deform the overlying epithelium into buds. The mechanical anisotropy needed to shape buds into tubes is conferred by a polarized distribution of actomyosin and E-cadherin-rich membrane tethers, which we term cytocinches. Most work on tissue morphogenesis ascribes actomyosin contractility as the driving force, while the extracellular matrix shapes tissues through differential stiffness. Our work inverts this expectation. Hyaluronate pressure shaped by anisotropic tissue stiffness may be a widespread mechanism for powering morphological change in organogenesis and tissue engineering.},

Genetic factors are thought to specify patterns of growth and other behaviors to drive morphogenesis. Here, we show that tissue form itself can feed back to regulate patterns of proliferation. Using microfabrication to control the organization of sheets of cells, we demonstrated the emergence of stable patterns of proliferative foci. Regions of concentrated growth corresponded to regions of high tractional stress generated within the sheet, as predicted by a finite-element model of multicellular mechanics and measured directly by using a micromechanical force sensor array. Inhibiting actomyosin-based tension or cadherin-mediated connections between cells disrupted the spatial pattern of proliferation. These findings demonstrate the existence of patterns of mechanical forces that originate from the contraction of cells, emerge from their multicellular organization, and result in patterns of growth. Thus, tissue form is not only a consequence but also an active regulator of tissue growth.},

These mechanical instabilities cause essentially one-dimensional epithelial tubes and two-dimensional epithelial sheets to buckle or wrinkle into complex topologies containing loops, folds, and undulations in organs as diverse as the brain, the intestine, and the lung.

Higher transmural pressure decreases the interval between systemic smooth muscle contractions and increases the rate of morphogenesis of the airway epithelium.

  abstract = {Wrinkling is a ubiquitous surface phenomenon in many biological tissues and is believed to play an important role in arterial health. As arteries are highly nonlinear, anisotropic, multilayered composite systems, it is necessary to investigate wrinkling incorporating these material characteristics. Several studies have examined surface wrinkling mechanisms with nonlinear isotropic material relationships. Nevertheless, wrinkling associated with anisotropic constitutive models such as Ogden\textendash Gasser\textendash Holzapfel (OGH), which is suitable for soft biological tissues, and in particular arteries, still requires investigation. Here, the effects of OGH parameters such as fibers' orientation, stiffness, and dispersion on the onset of wrinkling, wrinkle wavelength and amplitude are elucidated through analysis of a bilayer system composed of a thin, stiff neo-Hookean membrane and a soft OGH substrate subjected to compression. Critical contractile strain at which wrinkles occur is predicted using both finite element analysis and analytical linear perturbation approach. Results suggest that besides stiffness mismatch, anisotropic features associated with fiber stiffness and distribution might be used in natural layered systems to adjust wrinkling and subsequent folding behaviors. Further analysis of a bilayer system with fibers in the (x\textendash y) plane subjected to compression in the x direction shows a complex dependence of wrinkling strain and wavelength on fiber angle, stiffness, and dispersion. This behavior is captured by an approximation utilizing the linearized anisotropic properties derived from OGH model. Such understanding of wrinkling in this artery wall-like system will help identify the role of wrinkling mechanisms in biological artery in addition to the design of its synthetic counterparts.},

Various system theories were proposed to provide a more adequate understanding of biological systems, including development. Although widely ignored by modern biology, the first systematic system theory was Hegel's dialectics. Here I examine the process of embryonic induction as elaborated by Hans Spemann in the light of dialectics. I conclude that embryonic induction and its underlying molecular mechanisms can be re-interpreted in terms of Hegel's dialectics. The example highlights that despite its shortcomings, dialectics can be of heuristic value as a theory of systems biology.},

It remains unclear how F-actin hydrolyses ATP and subsequently undergoes subtle conformational rearrangements that ultimately lead to filament depolymerization by actin-binding proteins. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of F-actin in all nucleotide states, polymerized in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ at approximately 2.2\,\AA{} resolution. The structures show that actin polymerization induces the relocation of water molecules in the nucleotide-binding pocket, activating one of them for the nucleophilic attack of ATP. Unexpectedly, the back door for the subsequent release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is closed in all structures, indicating that Pi release occurs transiently. The small changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket after ATP hydrolysis and Pi release are sensed by a key amino acid, amplified and transmitted to the filament periphery. Furthermore, differences in the positions of water molecules in the nucleotide-binding pocket explain why Ca2+-actin shows slower polymerization rates than Mg2+-actin. Our work elucidates the solvent-driven rearrangements that govern actin filament assembly and aging and lays the foundation for the rational design of drugs and small molecules for imaging and therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Epithelial monolayers perform a variety of mechanical functions, which include maintaining a cohesive barrier or developing 3D shapes, while undergoing stretches over a wide range of magnitudes and loading rates. To perform these functions, they rely on a hierarchical organization, which spans molecules, cytoskeletal networks, adhesion complexes and junctional networks up to the tissue scale. While the molecular understanding and ability to manipulate cytoskeletal components within cells is rapidly increasing, how these components integrate to control tissue mechanics is far less understood, partly due to the disconnect between theoretical models of sub-cellular dynamics and those at a tissue scale. To fill this gap, here we propose a formalism bridging active-gel models of the actomyosin cortex and 3D vertex-like models at a tissue scale. We show that this unified framework recapitulates a number of seemingly disconnected epithelial time-dependent phenomenologies, including stress relaxation following stretch/unstretch maneuvers, active flattening after buckling, pulsatile non-affine contractions, or active superelasticity. Overall, the proposed framework systematically connects sub-cellular cortical dynamics and tissue mechanics, and ties a variety of epithelial phenomenologies to a common sub-cellular origin.},

This morphogenesis is considered to be triggered by mechanical instabilities between the epithelial sheet and the mesenchyme foundation, similar to that observed in non-living filmon-substrate structures. Here, we report a film-on-substrate cell culture system (FoSS), in which the cells can induce wrinkling and buckling-delamination of the surface layer from the foundation. Ion beam irradiation on polylactic acid (PLA) produced three layers: a crosslinked/carbonized surface, a decomposed middle layer that undergoes solation under the cell culture condition, and a foundation. This system was realized by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) distributions of scission/crosslinking probabilities in PLA. Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells adhered well to the surface layer of FoSS. Cellular forces caused the layer to become wrinkled and subsequently delaminated as a thin film (\textasciitilde 165 nm) from the foundation. The cell population then crumpled the peeled films, and within 48 h formed 3D cell sheets with folds and protrusions depending on patterns pre-set on the FoSS. FoSS can be utilized to produce in vitro models of 3D morphogenesis and 3D cell sheets that are currently in demand for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

Contractility becomes first visible with the appearance of periodic cortical waves of contraction (PeCoWaCo), which travel around blastomeres in an oscillatory fashion. How contractility of the mouse embryo becomes active remains unknown. We have taken advantage of PeCoWaCo to study the awakening of contractility during preimplantation development. We find that PeCoWaCo become detectable in most embryos only after the second cleavage and gradually increase their oscillation frequency with each successive cleavage. To test the influence of cell size reduction during cleavage divisions, we use cell fusion and fragmentation to manipulate cell size across a 20- to 60-{$\mu$}m range. We find that the stepwise reduction in cell size caused by cleavage divisions does not explain the presence of PeCoWaCo or their accelerating rhythm. Instead, we discover that blastomeres gradually decrease their surface tensions until the 8-cell stage and that artificially softening cells enhances PeCoWaCo prematurely. We further identify the programmed down-regulation of the formin Fmnl3 as a required event to soften the cortex and expose PeCoWaCo. Therefore, during cleavage stages, cortical softening, mediated by Fmnl3 down-regulation, awakens zygotic contractility before preimplantation morphogenesis.},

Unfortunately, the soft and flexible materials used in their construction impose intrinsic limitations on soft robots, such as low actuation speeds and low output forces. Nature offers multiple examples where highly flexible organisms exploit mechanical instabilities to store and rapidly release energy. Guided by these examples, researchers have recently developed a variety of strategies to overcome speed and power limitations in soft robotics using mechanical instabilities. These mechanical instabilities provide, through rapid transitions from structurally stable states, a new route to achieve high output power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. Here, an overview of the literature related to the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. Additionally, strategies using structural phase transitions to address current challenges in the area of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation are discussed. Approaches using instabilities to create entirely soft logic modules to imbue soft robots with material intelligence and distributed computational capabilities are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {The directed migration of cellular clusters enables morphogenesis, wound healing and collective cancer invasion. Gradients of substrate stiffness direct the migration of cellular clusters in a process called collective durotaxis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we unveil a connection between collective durotaxis and the wetting properties of cellular clusters. We show that clusters of cancer cells dewet soft substrates and wet stiff ones. At intermediate stiffness\textemdash at the crossover from low to high wettability\textemdash clusters on uniform-stiffness substrates become maximally motile, and clusters on stiffness gradients exhibit optimal durotaxis. Durotactic velocity increases with cluster size, stiffness gradient and actomyosin activity. We demonstrate this behaviour on substrates coated with the cell\textendash cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and then establish its generality on substrates coated with extracellular matrix. We develop an active wetting model that explains collective durotaxis in terms of a balance between in-plane active traction and tissue contractility and out-of-plane surface tension. Finally, we show that the distribution of cluster displacements has a heavy tail, with infrequent but large cellular hops that contribute to durotactic migration. Our study demonstrates a physical mechanism of collective durotaxis, through both cell\textendash cell and cell\textendash substrate adhesion ligands, based on the wetting properties of active droplets.},

Although architecturally simple, a complex pattern of airflow is thought to be achieved in the lizard lung due to its cavernous central lumen and honeycomb-shaped wall. We find that the wall of the lizard lung is generated from an initially smooth epithelial sheet, which is pushed through holes in a hexagonal smooth muscle meshwork by forces from fluid pressure, similar to a stress ball. Combining transcriptomics with time-lapse imaging reveals that the hexagonal meshwork self-assembles in response to circumferential and axial stresses downstream of pressure. A computational model predicts the pressure-driven changes in epithelial topology, which we probe using optogenetically driven contraction of 3D-printed engineered muscle. These results reveal the physical principles used to sculpt the unusual architecture of the lizard lung, which could be exploited as a novel strategy to engineer tissues.},

In the avian skin, assembly into follicles depends on intrinsic mechanical forces of the dermis, but how cell mechanics initiate pattern formation is not known. Here, we reconstitute the initiation of follicle patterning ex~vivo using only freshly dissociated avian dermal cells and collagen. We find that contractile cells physically rearrange the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that ECM rearrangement further aligns cells. This exchange transforms a mechanically unlinked collective of dermal cells into a continuum, with coherent, long-range order. Combining theory with experiment, we show that this ordered cell-ECM layer behaves as an active contractile fluid that spontaneously forms regular patterns. Our study illustrates a role for mesenchymal dynamics in generating cell-level ordering and tissue-level patterning through a fluid instability\textemdash processes that may be at play across morphological symmetry-breaking contexts.},

The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly understood, however, and structural properties characterizing these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly, the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell\textendash cell adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural signature for classification and investigation of bronchial epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics play a prominent role.},

In analogy with the behaviour of inert fluids, some of these transitions have been interpreted as wetting transitions. The validity and scope of this analogy are unclear, however, because the active cellular forces that drive tissue wetting have been neither measured nor theoretically accounted for. Here we show that the transition between two-dimensional epithelial monolayers and three-dimensional spheroidal aggregates can be understood as an active wetting transition whose physics differs fundamentally from that of passive wetting phenomena. By combining an active polar fluid model with measurements of physical forces as a function of tissue size, contractility, cell\textendash cell and cell\textendash substrate adhesion, and substrate stiffness, we show that the wetting transition results from the competition between traction forces and contractile intercellular stresses. This competition defines a new intrinsic length scale that gives rise to a critical size for the wetting transition in tissues, a striking feature that has no counterpart in classical wetting. Finally, we show that active shape fluctuations are dynamically amplified during tissue dewetting. Overall, we conclude that tissue spreading constitutes a prominent example of active wetting\textemdash a novel physical scenario that may explain morphological transitions during tissue morphogenesis and tumour progression.},

Each of these processes and their coordination require patterned forces that are at present unknown. Here we map three-dimensional cellular forces in mouse intestinal organoids grown on soft hydrogels. We show that these organoids exhibit a non-monotonic stress distribution that defines mechanical and functional compartments. The stem cell compartment pushes the extracellular matrix and folds through apical constriction, whereas the transit amplifying zone pulls the extracellular matrix and elongates through basal constriction. The size of the stem cell compartment depends on the extracellular-matrix stiffness and endogenous cellular forces. Computational modelling reveals that crypt shape and force distribution rely on cell surface tensions following cortical actomyosin density. Finally, cells are pulled out of the crypt along a gradient of increasing tension. Our study unveils how patterned forces enable compartmentalization, folding and collective migration in the intestinal epithelium.},

We calculate a critical surface curvature, given by an intrinsic characteristic length scale of the fouling layer that accounts for its effective flexural or bending stiffness and adhesion energy, beyond which surface renewal occurs. The effective bending stiffness includes the elasticity and thickness of the fouling patch, but also the boundary layer depth of the imposed wrinkled topography. The analytical scaling laws are validated using finite-element simulations and physical experiments. Our data span over five orders of magnitude in critical curvatures and are well normalized by the analytically calculated scaling. Moreover, our numerics suggests an energy-release mechanism whereby stored elastic energy in the fouling layer drives surface renewal. The strategy is broadly applicable to any surface with tunable topography and fouling layers with elastic response.},

Tissue boundaries such as epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces are engines for morphogenesis in vivo. However, despite a wealth of micropatterning approaches available to control tissue size, shape, and mechanical environment in vitro, fine-scale spatial control of cell composition within tissue constructs remains an engineering challenge. To address this, we augment DNA velcro technology for selective patterning of ssDNA-labeled cells with long-term culture on mechanically defined polyacrylamide hydrogels. We co-functionalize photoactive benzophenone-containing polyacrylamide gels (BP-PA gels) with spatially precise ssDNA features that confer temporary cell adhesion and with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that confer long-term adhesion. We find that co-functionalization does not compromise ssDNA patterning fidelity or cell capture, nor hydrogel mechanical properties or mechanosensitive fibroblast spreading, enabling mechanobiology studies of precise cell interfaces. We then co-pattern colonies of fibroblasts and epithelial cells to study interface formation and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activity at cellular contacts. Combining DNA velcro and ECM functionalization approaches provides independent control of initial cell placement, adhesion, and mechanical environment, constituting a new tool for studying biological interfaces and for programming multicellular interactions in engineered tissues.},

Previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation measurements of cells cultured on deformable substrates have suggested that cells adapt their stiffness to that of their surroundings. Here we show that the force applied by AFM to a cell results in a significant deformation of the underlying substrate if this substrate is softer than the cell. This `soft substrate effect' leads to an underestimation of a cell's elastic modulus when analysing data using a standard Hertz model, as confirmed by finite element modelling and AFM measurements of calibrated polyacrylamide beads, microglial cells and fibroblasts. To account for this substrate deformation, we developed a `composite cell\textendash substrate model'. Correcting for the substrate indentation revealed that cortical cell stiffness is largely independent of substrate mechanics, which has major implications for our interpretation of many physiological and pathological processes.},

  abstract = {In many proliferating epithelia, cells present a polygonal shape that results from tensile forces of the cytoskeletal cortex and from the packing geometry set by the cell cycle1, 2. In the larval Drosophila epidermis, two cell populations, histoblasts and larval epithelial cells, compete for space as they grow on a limited body surface. They do so in the absence of cell divisions. Here we show that histoblasts, which are initially polygonal, undergo a dramatic morphological transition in the course of larval development. Histoblasts change from a tensed network configuration, with straight cell outlines at the level of adherens junctions, to a highly folded morphology. The apical surface of histoblasts shrinks while their growing adherens junctions fold. Volume increase of growing histoblasts is accommodated basally, compensating for the shrinking apical area. The folded geometry of apical junctions is reminiscent of elastic buckling. In accordance, we show that folding of junctions results from an imbalance between the growth of the junctions and the increasing crowding of the epidermis. The process also correlates with a change in the junctional acto-myosin cortex and possibly mechanical properties. We propose a model in which crowding of the epidermis imposes a compressive load on the growing junctions which induces their buckling. Buckling effectively compacts histoblasts at their apical plane and may serve to avoid physical harm to these adult epidermis precursors during larval life. Our work also indicates that in growing non-dividing cells, compressive forces, instead of tension, may drive cell morphology.},

Regulating their size and shape is crucial for their function. Although chemical signaling has been thought to play a role in the regulation of cellular processes that feed into larger scales, it is increasingly recognized that mechanical forces are involved in the modulation of size and shape at larger length scales. Motivated by a variety of examples of tissue cyst formation and size control that show simultaneous growth and size oscillations, we create a minimal theoretical framework for the growth and dynamics of a soft, fluid-permeable, spherical shell. We show that these shells can relieve internal pressure by bursting intermittently, shrinking and re-growing, providing a simple mechanism by which hydraulically gated oscillations can regulate size. To test our theory, we develop an in vitro experimental set-up to monitor the growth and oscillations of a hollow tissue spheroid growing freely or when confined. A simple generalization of our theory to account for irreversible deformations allows us to explain the time scales and the amplitudes of oscillations in terms of the geometry and mechanical properties of the tissue shells. Taken together, our theory and experimental observations show how soft hydraulics can regulate the size of growing tissue shells.},

  abstract = {Developmental biology has advanced the understanding of the intricate and dynamic processes involved in the formation of an organism from a single cell. However, many gaps remain in the knowledge of embryonic development, especially regarding tissue morphogenesis. A possible approach to mimic such phenomena uses pluripotent stem cells in in vitro morphogenetic models. Herein, these systems are summarized with emphasis on the ability to better manipulate and control cellular interfaces with either liquid or solid materials using microengineered tools, which is critical for attaining deeper insights into pattern formation and stem cell differentiation during organogenesis. The role of conventional and customized cell-culture systems in supporting important advances in the field of morphogenesis is discussed, and the fascinating role that material sciences and microengineering currently play and are expected to play in the future is highlighted. In conclusion, it is proffered that continued microfluidics innovations when applied to morphogenesis promise to provide important insights to advance many multidisciplinary fields, including regenerative medicine.},

Microengineered organ-on-chip (or Organ-Chip) systems are designed to emulate microvolume cytoarchitecture and enable co-culture of distinct cell types. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) share common signaling pathways with neurons early in development, but their contribution to human neuronal maturation is largely unknown. To study this interaction and influence of microculture, we derived both spinal motor neurons and BMECs from human induced pluripotent stem cells and observed increased calcium transient function and Chip-specific gene expression in Organ-Chips compared with 96-well plates. Seeding BMECs in the Organ-Chip led to vascular-neural interaction and specific gene activation that further enhanced neuronal function and in vivo-like signatures. The results show that the vascular system has specific maturation effects on spinal cord neural tissue, and the use of Organ-Chips can move stem cell models closer to an in~vivo condition.},

Here we use developmental experiments to eliminate alternative models and show that gut looping morphogenesis is driven by the homogeneous and isotropic forces that arise from the relative growth between the gut tube and the anchoring dorsal mesenteric sheet, tissues that grow at different rates. A simple physical mimic, using a differentially strained composite of a pliable rubber tube and a soft latex sheet is consistent with this mechanism and produces similar patterns. We devise a mathematical theory and a computational model for the number, size and shape of intestinal loops based solely on the measurable geometry, elasticity and relative growth of the tissues. The predictions of our theory are quantitatively consistent with observations of intestinal loops at different stages of development in the chick embryo. Our model also accounts for the qualitative and quantitative variation in the distinct gut looping patterns seen in a variety of species including quail, finch and mouse, illuminating how the simple macroscopic mechanics of differential growth drives the morphology of the developing gut.},

In vitro reconstituted molecular networks, as well as single-cell cytoskeletons show that their filamentous structures can portray nematic liquid crystalline properties and can promote nonequilibrium processes induced by active processes at the microscale. The appearance of collective patterns, the formation of topological singularities, and spontaneous phase transition within the cell cytoskeleton are emergent properties that drive cellular functions. More integrated systems such as tissues have cells that can be seen as coarse-grained active nematic particles and their interaction can dictate many important tissue processes such as epithelial cell extrusion and migration as observed in vitro and in vivo. Here, a brief introduction to the concept of active nematics is provided, and the main focus is on the use of this framework in the systematic study of predominantly 2D tissue architectures and dynamics in vitro. In addition how the nematic state is important in tissue behavior, such as epithelial expansion, tissue homeostasis, and the atherosclerosis disease state, is discussed. Finally, how the nematic organization of cells can be controlled in vitro for tissue engineering purposes is briefly discussed.},

The relevance of surface curvature in biology has been supported by numerous recent experimental and theoretical investigations in recent years. In this review, we first give a brief introduction to the key ideas of surface curvature in the context of biological systems and discuss the challenges that arise when measuring surface curvature. Giving an overview of the emergence of curvature in biological systems, its significance at different length scales becomes apparent. On the other hand, summarizing current findings also shows that both single cells and entire cell sheets, tissues or organisms respond to curvature by modulating their shape and their migration behavior. Finally, we address the interplay between the distribution of morphogens or micro-organisms and the emergence of curvature across length scales with examples demonstrating these key mechanistic principles of morphogenesis. Overall, this review highlights that curved interfaces are not merely a passive by-product of the chemical, biological and mechanical processes but that curvature acts also as a signal that co-determines these processes.

Essential features of this wave generation and propagation are captured by a minimal model based on sequential fronts of cytoskeletal reinforcement and fluidization. These findings establish a mechanism of long-range cell guidance, symmetry breaking and pattern formation during monolayer expansion.},

Mechanisms governing such morphogenetic movements have been studied only within a local region, a single germlayer or in whole embryos without cell identity. Scale-bridging imaging and automated analysis of cell dynamics are needed for a deeper understanding of tissue formation during gastrulation. Here, we report pan-embryo analyses of formation and dynamics of all three germlayers simultaneously within a developing zebrafish embryo. We show that a distinct distribution of cells in each germlayer is established during early gastrulation via cell movement characteristics that are predominantly determined by their position in the embryo. The differences in initial germlayer distributions are subsequently amplified by a global movement, which organizes the organ precursors along the embryonic body axis, giving rise to the blueprint of organ formation.

The molecular cycling of actomyosin crossbridges has typically been assumed to be rate limiting, but muscle is a soft, wet and active tissue that is spatially heterogeneous and heirarchically organized across multiple scales. We propose a minimal multiscale model that describes muscle as an active sponge and show how contractions generically induce intracellular fluid flow and power active hydraulic oscillations which dictate the fastest rate of muscle contraction. A key feature is the presence of spatially heterogeneous strains and local volumetric deformations, which we validate by reanalyzing data from existing experiments across different species and muscle types. We further demonstrate that the viscoelastic response of muscle is naturally nonreciprocal (or `odd') due to its active and anisotropic nature and highlight a novel consequence, whereby periodic cycles in strain alone can produce work. Our work suggests a revised view of muscle dynamics that emphasizes the multiscale spatial aspects in addition to temporal aspects, with implications for physiology, biomechanics and locomotion.},

The gradient moves with the neural crest, which is continually pursuing a retreating region of high substrate stiffness. Mechanistically, the neural crest induces the gradient due to N-cadherin interactions with the placodes and senses the gradient through cell\textendash matrix adhesions, resulting in polarized Rac activity and actomyosin contractility, which coordinates durotaxis. Durotaxis synergizes with chemotaxis, cooperatively polarizing actomyosin machinery of the cell group to prompt efficient directional collective cell migration in vivo. These results show that durotaxis and dynamic stiffness gradients exist in vivo, and gradients of chemical and mechanical signals cooperate to achieve efficient directional cell migration.},

While it is becoming increasingly clear that the ionic microenvironment and external electric stimuli can affect epithelial function and behavior, the coupling between electrical perturbation and tissue form remain unclear. We investigated this by combining electrical stimulation with three-dimensional epithelial tissues with hollow `lumens'\textemdash both kidney cysts and complex intestinal stem cell organoids. Our core finding is that physiological strength electrical stimulation of order 1-3 V/cm (with both direct and alternating currents) can drive powerful and rapid inflation of hollow tissues through a process we call `electro-inflation', inducing a nearly three-fold increase in tissue volume and striking asymmetries in tissue form. Electro-inflation is primarily driven by activation of the CFTR ion channel pumping chloride into the tissue, causing water to osmotically flow. This influx generates hydrostatic pressure, and inflation results from a competition between this pressure and cell cytoskeletal tension. We validated these interpretations with computational models connecting ion dynamics in the Diffuse Double Layer around tissues to tissue mechanics. Electro-inflation is a unique biophysical process to study and control complex tissue function.},

Concurrently, this dermal cell aggregation triggers the mechanosensitive activation of {$\beta$}-catenin in adjacent epidermal cells, initiating the follicle gene expression program.

Organogenesis often starts with the formation of characteristically shaped organ precursors. However, the cellular mechanisms driving organ precursor formation are often not clear. Here, using zebrafish, we investigate the epithelial rearrangements responsible for the development of the hemispherical retinal neuroepithelium (RNE), a part of the optic cup. We show that in addition to basal shrinkage of RNE cells, active migration of connected epithelial cells into the RNE is a crucial player in its formation. This cellular movement is driven by progressive cell-matrix contacts and actively translocates prospective RNE cells to their correct location before they adopt neuroepithelial fate. Failure of this migration during neuroepithelium formation leads to ectopic determination of RNE cells and consequently impairs optic cup formation. Overall, this study illustrates how spatiotemporal coordination between morphogenic movements and fate determination critically influences organogenesis.},

  abstract = {Epithelia act as barriers against environmental stresses. They are continuously exposed to various mechanical stress and abrasion, which impact epithelial integrity. The impact of the environment on epithelial integrity remains elusive. By culturing epithelial cells on two-dimensional hydrogels, we observe a loss of epithelial monolayer integrity on soft substrates through spontaneous hole formation. These monolayer ruptures are associated with local cellular stretching and cell-division events. Substrate stiffness triggers an unanticipated mechanical switch of epithelial monolayers from compressive stress on stiff substrates to highly tensile on soft, favouring hole formation. In agreement with an active nematic model, hole-opening events occur preferentially near spontaneous half-integer topological defects, which underpin large isotropic stress fluctuations triggering stochastic mechanical failure. Our results thus show that substrate stiffness provides feedback on the mechanical state of epithelial monolayers with potential application towards a mechanistic understanding of compromised epithelial integrity during normal and pathological human ontogenesis.},

  abstract = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) is comprised of different types of proteins, which change in composition and ratios during morphogenesis and disease progression. ECM proteins provide cell adhesion and impart mechanical cues to the cells. Increasing substrate stiffness has been shown to induce Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, yet these mechanistic studies used fibronectin only as the biochemical cue. How varying the types of ECM modulates mechanotransduction of stem cells remains largely unknown. Using polyacrylamide hydrogels with tunable stiffness as substrates, here we conjugated four major ECM proteins commonly used for cell adhesion: fibronectin, collagen I, collagen IV and laminin, and assessed the effects of varying ECM type and density on YAP translocation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). For all four ECM types, increasing ECM ligand density alone can induce YAP nuclear translocation without changing substrate stiffness. The ligand threshold for such biochemical ligand-induced YAP translocation differs across ECM types. While stiffness-dependent YAP translocation can be induced by all four ECM types, each ECM requires a different optimized ligand density for this to occur. Using antibody blocking, we further identified integrin subunits specifically involved in mechanotransduction of different ECM types. Finally, we demonstrated that altering ECM type further modulates hMSC osteogenesis without changing substrate stiffness. These findings highlight the important role of ECM type in modulating mechanotransduction and differentiation of stem cells, and call for future mechanistic studies to further elucidate the role of changes in ECM compositions in mediating mechanotransduction during morphogenesis and disease progression. Statement of Significance Our study addresses a critical gap of knowledge in mechanobiology. Increasing substrate stiffness has been shown to induce nuclear YAP translocation, yet only on fibronectin-coated substrates. However, extracellular matrix (ECM) is comprised of different protein types. How varying the type of ECM modulates stem cell mechanotransduction remains largely unknown. We here reveal that the choice of ECM type can directly modulate stem cell mechanotransduction, filling this critical gap. This work has broad impacts in mechanobiology and biomaterials, as it provides the first evidence that varying ECM type can impact YAP translocation independent of substrate stiffness, opening doors for a more rational biomaterials design tuning ECM properties to control cell fate for promoting normal development and for preventing disease progression.},

Here, we use the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis as a developmental model to uncover a mechanistic link between organism size, shape and behavior. Using quantitative live imaging, including extensive behavioral profiling, combined with molecular and biophysical experiments, we demonstrate that the muscular hydraulic machinery that controls body movement directly drives larva-polyp morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, size and shape development are differentially controlled by antagonistic muscles. A simple theoretical model shows how a combination of slow-priming and fast-pumping pressures generated by muscular hydraulics acts as a global mechanical regulator that coordinates tissue remodeling. Altogether, our findings illuminate how dynamic behavioral modes in the environment can be harnessed to drive morphogenetic trajectories, establishing ethology as a critical component of organismal morphogenesis \textendash{} termed ethology of morphogenesis.},

Epithelial folding has mainly been attributed to mechanical forces generated by an apically localized actomyosin network, however, contributions of forces generated at basal and lateral cell surfaces remain largely unknown. Here we show that a local decrease of basal tension and an increased lateral tension, but not apical constriction, drive the formation of two neighboring folds in developing Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Spatially defined reduction of extracellular matrix density results in local decrease of basal tension in the first fold; fluctuations in F-actin lead to increased lateral tension in the second fold. Simulations using a 3D vertex model show that the two distinct mechanisms can drive epithelial folding. Our combination of lateral and basal tension measurements with a mechanical tissue model reveals how simple modulations of surface and edge tension drive complex three-dimensional morphological changes.},

To explain the observed phenomenology, we developed a generalized clutch model in which local stick-slip dynamics of cell-matrix adhesions was integrated to the tissue level through cell-cell junctions. Collective durotaxis is far more efficient than single-cell durotaxis; it thus emerges as a robust mechanism to direct cell migration during development, wound healing, and collective cancer cell invasion.},

  abstract = {An important step in epithelial organ development is size maturation of the organ lumen to attain correct dimensions. Here we show that the regulated expression of Tenectin (Tnc) is critical to shape the Drosophila melanogaster hindgut tube. Tnc is a secreted protein that fills the embryonic hindgut lumen during tube diameter expansion. Inside the lumen, Tnc contributes to detectable O-Glycans and forms a dense striated matrix. Loss of tnc causes a narrow hindgut tube, while Tnc over-expression drives tube dilation in a dose-dependent manner. Cellular analyses show that luminal accumulation of Tnc causes an increase in inner and outer tube diameter, and cell flattening within the tube wall, similar to the effects of a hydrostatic pressure in other systems. When Tnc expression is induced only in cells at one side of the tube wall, Tnc fills the lumen and equally affects all cells at the lumen perimeter, arguing that Tnc acts non-cell-autonomously. Moreover, when Tnc expression is directed to a segment of a tube, its luminal accumulation is restricted to this segment and affects the surrounding cells to promote a corresponding local diameter expansion. These findings suggest that deposition of Tnc into the lumen might contribute to expansion of the lumen volume, and thereby to stretching of the tube wall. Consistent with such an idea, ectopic expression of Tnc in different developing epithelial tubes is sufficient to cause dilation, while epidermal Tnc expression has no effect on morphology. Together, the results show that epithelial tube diameter can be modelled by regulating the levels and pattern of expression of a single luminal glycoprotein.},

Substrates or interfaces associated with these processes are typically curved, with radii of curvature comparable to many cell lengths. Using both artificial geometries and lung alveolospheres derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, here we show that cells sense multicellular-scale curvature and that it plays a role in regulating collective cell migration. As the curvature of a monolayer increases, cells reduce their collectivity and the multicellular flow field becomes more dynamic. Furthermore, hexagonally shaped cells tend to aggregate in solid-like clusters surrounded by non-hexagonal cells that act as a background fluid. We propose that cells naturally form hexagonally organized clusters to minimize free energy, and the size of these clusters is limited by a bending energy penalty. We observe that cluster size grows linearly as sphere radius increases, which further stabilizes the multicellular flow field and increases cell collectivity. As a result, increasing curvature tends to promote the fluidity in multicellular monolayer. Together, these findings highlight the potential for a fundamental role of curvature in regulating both spatial and temporal characteristics of three-dimensional multicellular systems.},

Inhibiting cell proliferation limits cell density increase and prevents jamming; we observe long-duration migration and quantify space\textendash time characteristics of the velocity profile over large length scales and time scales. Velocity waves propagate backwards and their frequency depends only on cell density at the moving front. Both cell average velocity and wave velocity increase linearly with the cell effective radius regardless of the distance to the front. Inhibiting lamellipodia decreases cell velocity while waves either disappear or have a lower frequency. Our model combines conservation laws, monolayer mechanical properties and a phenomenological coupling between strain and polarity: advancing cells pull on their followers, which then become polarized. With reasonable values of parameters, this model agrees with several of our experimental observations. Together, our experiments and model disantangle the respective contributions of active velocity and of proliferation in monolayer migration, explain how cells maintain their polarity far from the moving front, and highlight the importance of strain\textendash polarity coupling and density in long-range information propagation.},

We show that the primary response is an active and transient osmotic swelling of cells. This cell volume increase is not observed on inducible wrinkled substrates, where concave and convex regions alternate each other over short distances; and this finding identifies swelling as a collective response to changes of curvature with a persistent sign over large distances. It is triggered by a drop in membrane tension and actin depolymerization, which is perceived by cells as a hypertonic shock. Osmotic swelling restores tension while actin reorganizes, probably to comply with curvature. Thus, epithelia are unique materials that transiently and actively swell while adapting to large curvature induction.},

  abstract = {Epithelial tissues are composed of layers of tightly connected cells shaped into complex three-dimensional (3D) structures such as cysts, tubules, or invaginations. These complex 3D structures are important for organ-specific functions and often create biochemical gradients that guide cell positioning and compartmentalization within the organ. One of the main functions of epithelia is to act as physical barriers that protect the underlying tissues from external insults. In vitro, epithelial barriers are usually mimicked by oversimplified models based on cell lines grown as monolayers on flat surfaces. While useful to answer certain questions, these models cannot fully capture the in vivo organ physiology and often yield poor predictions. In order to progress further in basic and translational research, disease modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine, it is essential to advance the development of new in vitro predictive models of epithelial tissues that are capable of representing the in vivo-like structures and organ functionality more accurately. Here, we review current strategies for obtaining biomimetic systems in the form of advanced in vitro models that allow for more reliable and safer preclinical tests. The current state of the art and potential applications of self-organized cell-based systems, organ-on-a-chip devices that incorporate sensors and monitoring capabilities, as well as microfabrication techniques including bioprinting and photolithography, are discussed. These techniques could be combined to help provide highly predictive drug tests for patient-specific conditions in the near future.},

Solute pumping by the cell, hydraulic flows driven by differences of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures, balance of forces between extracellular fluids and cell-generated cytoskeletal forces, and electro-osmotic effects have been implicated in determining the dynamics and steady-state of lumens. We use the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics to discuss the relevant force, time and length scales involved in these processes.

To identify material properties that impact angiogenesis, here we have developed an in vitro model whereby molded tubular channels inside a synthetic hydrogel are seeded with endothelial cells and subjected to chemokine gradients within a microfluidic device. To accomplish precision molding of hydrogels and successful integration with microfluidics, we developed a class of hydrogels that could be macromolded and micromolded with high shape and size fidelity by eliminating swelling after polymerization. Using this material, we demonstrate that matrix degradability switches three-dimensional endothelial cell invasion between two distinct modes: single-cell migration and the multicellular, strand-like invasion required for angiogenesis. The ability to incorporate these tunable hydrogels into geometrically constrained settings will enable a wide range of previously inaccessible biomedical applications.},

In contrast, compressive stresses have been proposed to fold a homogeneous epithelium by buckling. While buckling is an appealing mechanism, demonstrating that it underlies folding requires measurement of the stress field and the material properties of the tissue, which are currently inaccessible in~vivo. Here, we show that monolayers of identical cells proliferating on the inner surface of elastic spherical shells can spontaneously fold. By measuring the elastic deformation of the shell, we infer the forces acting within the monolayer and its elastic modulus. Using analytical and numerical theories linking forces to shape, we find that buckling quantitatively accounts for the shape changes of our monolayers. Our study shows that forces arising from epithelial growth in three-dimensional confinement are sufficient to drive folding by buckling.},

In this paper we show that dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 5' AMP, adenosine and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors stimulate hemicyst formation by the dog kidney cell line MDCK. It is suggested that this effect is explained by elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels by means of an exogenous non-metabolizable source of cyclic AMP, phosphodiesterase inhibition or adenyl cyclase stimulation. Since hemicyst formation is in part due to transepithelial fluid transport, these findings raise the possibility that this fraction might be modulated by cAMP in a n established cell line. We believe that cultured epithelial cells may provide an exploitable model system to investigate a t the cellular and subcellular levels, the mechanism by which cyclic AMP modifies water and solute movements across epithelia.},

It is now possible to investigate how mechanical signals induce downstream genetic regulatory networks to regulate key developmental processes in the embryo. Here, we review the insights into mechanical control of early vertebrate development, including the role of forces in tissue patterning and embryonic axis formation. We also highlight recent in vitro approaches using individual embryonic stem cells and self-organizing multicellular models of human embryos, which have been instrumental in expanding our understanding of how mechanics tune cell fate and cellular rearrangements during human embryonic development.},

We fused the catalytic domain (DHPH domain) of the RhoA activator ARHGEF11 to CRY2-mCherry (optoGEF-RhoA) and engineered its binding partner CIBN to bind either to the plasma membrane or to the mitochondrial membrane. Translocation of optoGEF-RhoA to the plasma membrane causes a rapid and local increase in cellular traction, intercellular tension and tissue compaction. By contrast, translocation of optoGEF-RhoA to mitochondria results in opposite changes in these physical properties. Cellular changes in contractility are paralleled by modifications in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulator YAP, thus showing the ability of our approach to control mechanotransductory signalling pathways in time and space.},

Here, however, we demonstrate that physical mechanisms can control the pattern of airway branching. Using a combination of 3D culture experiments and theoretical modeling, we show that a growth-induced physical instability initiates the formation of new epithelial branches. Tuning epithelial growth rate controls the dominant wavelength of the instability, and thereby the branching pattern. These findings emphasize the role of mechanical forces during morphogenesis and indicate that lung development is not a closed genetic system. Physical cues also regulate the spatially patterned cell behaviors that underlie organ assembly in the embryo.           ,              Collections of cells must be patterned spatially during embryonic development to generate the intricate architectures of mature tissues. In several cases, including the formation of the branched airways of the lung, reciprocal signaling between an epithelium and its surrounding mesenchyme helps generate these spatial patterns. Several molecular signals are thought to interact via reaction-diffusion kinetics to create distinct biochemical patterns, which act as molecular precursors to actual, physical patterns of biological structure and function. Here, however, we show that purely physical mechanisms can drive spatial patterning within embryonic epithelia. Specifically, we find that a growth-induced physical instability defines the relative locations of branches within the developing murine airway epithelium in the absence of mesenchyme. The dominant wavelength of this instability determines the branching pattern and is controlled by epithelial growth rates. These data suggest that physical mechanisms can create the biological patterns that underlie tissue morphogenesis in the embryo.},

However, lumens formed in other tissues adopt irregular shapes with cell apical faces that are bowed inward, suggesting that pressure may not be the dominant contributor to lumen shape in all cases. Here we use live-cell imaging to study the physical mechanism of lumen formation in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell spheroids, a canonical cell-culture model for lumenogenesis. We find that in this system, lumen shape reflects basic geometrical considerations tied to the establishment of apico-basal polarity.

Here, we show that the geometrical properties of the environment regulate the formation of collective cell migration patterns through cell\textendash cell interactions. Using microfabrication techniques to allow epithelial cell sheets to migrate into strips whose width was varied from one up to several cell diameters, we identified the modes of collective migration in response to geometrical constraints. We observed that a decrease in the width of the strips is accompanied by an overall increase in the speed of the migrating cell sheet. Moreover, large-scale vortices over tens of cell lengths appeared in the wide strips whereas a contraction-elongation type of motion is observed in the narrow strips. Velocity fields and traction force signatures within the cellular population revealed migration modes with alternative pulling and/or pushing mechanisms that depend on extrinsic constraints. Force transmission through intercellular contacts plays a key role in this process because the disruption of cell\textendash cell junctions abolishes directed collective migration and passive cell\textendash cell adhesions tend to move the cells uniformly together independent of the geometry. Altogether, these findings not only demonstrate the existence of patterns of collective cell migration depending on external constraints but also provide a mechanical explanation for how large-scale interactions through cell\textendash cell junctions can feed back to regulate the organization of migrating tissues.},

A detailed integrative understanding how these morphogenetic information modules pattern and shape the mammalian embryo is still lacking, mostly owing to the inaccessibility of the embryo in vivo for direct observation and manipulation. These impediments are circumvented by the developmental engineering of embryo-like structures (stembryos) from pluripotent stem cells that are easy to access, track, manipulate and scale. Here, we explain how unlocking distinct levels of embryo-like architecture through controlled modulations of the cellular environment enables the identification of minimal sets of mechanical and biochemical inputs necessary to pattern and shape the mammalian embryo. We detail how this can be complemented with precise measurements and manipulations of tissue biochemistry, mechanics and geometry across spatial and temporal scales to provide insights into the mechanochemical feedback loops governing embryo morphogenesis. Finally, we discuss how, even in the absence of active manipulations, stembryos display intrinsic phenotypic variability that can be leveraged to define the constraints that ensure reproducible morphogenesis in vivo.},

In this paper, using a well-defined single cell platform to induce cell-state transitions, we reveal the importance of actomyosin contractile forces in regulating the heterogeneous cell-fate decisions. Temporal analysis of laterally confined growth of fibroblasts revealed sequential changes in the colony morphology which was tightly coupled to the progressive erasure of lineage-specific transcription programs. Pseudo-trajectory constructed using unsupervised diffusion analysis of the colony morphology features revealed a bifurcation event in which some cells undergo successful cell state transitions towards partial reprogramming. Importantly, inhibiting actomyosin contractility before the bifurcation event leads to more efficient dedifferentiation. Taken together, this study highlights the presence of mechanical checkpoints that contribute to the heterogeneity in cell state transitions.},

  abstract = {Mechanics is known to play a fundamental role in many cellular and developmental processes. Beyond active forces and material properties, osmotic pressure is believed to control essential cell and tissue characteristics. However, it remains very challenging to perform in situ and in vivo measurements of osmotic pressure. Here we introduce double- emulsion droplet sensors that enable local measurements of osmotic pressure intra- and extra-cellularly within 3D multicellular systems, including living tissues. After generating and calibrating the sensors, we measured the osmotic pressure in blastomeres of early zebrafish embryos as well as in the interstitial fluid between the cells of the blastula by monitoring the size of droplets previously inserted in the embryo. Our results show a balance between intracellular and interstitial osmotic pressures, with values of approximately 0.7 MPa, but a large pressure imbalance between the inside and outside of the embryo. The ability to measure osmotic pressure in 3D multicellular systems (developing embryos, organoids, etc.) will help understand its role in fundamental biological processes.},

Cytoskeleton networks form complex intracellular structures that vary during the cell cycle and between different cell types according to their physiological role. These structures do not emerge spontaneously. They result from the interplay between intrinsic self-organization properties and the conditions imposed by spatial boundaries. Along these boundaries, cytoskeleton filaments are anchored, repulsed, aligned, or reoriented. Such local effects can propagate alterations throughout the network and guide cytoskeleton assembly over relatively large distances. The experimental manipulation of spatial boundaries using microfabrication methods has revealed the underlying physical processes directing cytoskeleton self-organization. Here we review, step-by-step, from molecules to tissues, how the rules that govern assembly have been identified. We describe how complementary approaches, all based on controlling geometric conditions, from in vitro reconstruction to in vivo observation, shed new light on these fundamental organizing principles.},

They allow a spatial resolution below the cellular scale and are applied particularly when problems are studied where multiple spatial and temporal scales are involved. Despite the increasing usage of CPMs in theoretical biology, this model class has received little attention from mathematical theory. To narrow this gap, the CPMs are subjected to a theoretical study here. It is asked to which extent the updating rules establish an appropriate dynamical model of intercellular interactions and what the principal behavior at different time scales characterizes. It is shown that the longtime behavior of a CPM is degenerate in the sense that the cells consecutively die out, independent of the specific interdependence structure that characterizes the model. While CPMs are naturally defined on finite, spatially bounded lattices, possible extensions to spatially unbounded systems are explored to assess to which extent spatio-temporal limit procedures can be applied to describe the emergent behavior at the tissue scale. To elucidate the mechanistic structure of CPMs, the model class is integrated into a general multiscale framework. It is shown that the central role of the surface fluctuations, which subsume several cellular and intercellular factors, entails substantial limitations for a CPM's exploitation both as a mechanistic and as a phenomenological model.},

These patterns can be classified into creases, wrinkles, folds, period-doubles, ridges and delaminated-buckles according to their distinctive topographical characteristics. One universal mechanism for the pattern formation has been long believed to be the mismatch strains between biological layers with different expanding or shrinking rates, which induce mechanical instabilities. However, a general model that accounts for the formation and evolution of these various surface-instability patterns still does not exist. Here, we take biological structures at their current states as thermodynamic systems, treat each instability pattern as a thermodynamic phase and construct a unified phase diagram that can quantitatively predict various types of growth-induced surface instabilities. We further validate the phase diagram with our experiments on surface instabilities induced by mismatch strains as well as the reported data on growth-induced instabilities in various biological systems. The predicted wavelengths and amplitudes of various instability patterns match well with our experimental data. It is expected that the unified phase diagram will not only advance the understanding of biological morphogenesis, but also significantly facilitate the design of new materials and structures by rationally harnessing surface instabilities.},

  abstract = {The human small intestinal epithelium possesses a distinct crypt-villus architecture and tissue polarity in which proliferative cells reside inside crypts while differentiated cells are localized to the villi. Indirect evidence has shown that the processes of differentiation and migration are driven in part by biochemical gradients of factors that specify the polarity of these cellular compartments; however, direct evidence for gradient-driven patterning of this in~vivo architecture has been hampered by limitations of the in~vitro systems available. Enteroid cultures are a powerful in~vitro system; nevertheless, these spheroidal structures fail to replicate the architecture and lineage compartmentalization found in~vivo, and are not easily subjected to gradients of growth factors. In the current work, we report the development of a micropatterned collagen scaffold with suitable extracellular matrix and stiffness to generate an in~vitro self-renewing human small intestinal epithelium that replicates key features of the in~vivo small intestine: a crypt-villus architecture with appropriate cell-lineage compartmentalization and an open and accessible luminal surface. Chemical gradients applied to the crypt-villus axis promoted the creation of a stem/progenitor-cell zone and supported cell migration along the crypt-villus axis. This new approach combining microengineered scaffolds, biophysical cues and chemical gradients to control the intestinal epithelium ex~vivo can serve as a physiologically relevant mimic of the human small intestinal epithelium, and is broadly applicable to model other tissues that rely on gradients for physiological function.},

Abnormalities in SMC organization are associated with many diseases including atherosclerosis, asthma, and uterine fibroids. Various studies have reported that SMCs cultured on flat surfaces can spontaneously form three-dimensional clusters whose organization resembles that encountered in some of these pathological settings. Remarkably, how these structures form remains unknown. Here we combine in vitro experiments and physical modeling to show that three-dimensional clusters initiate when cellular contractile forces induce a hole in a flat SMC sheet, a process that can be modeled as the brittle fracture of a viscoelastic material. The subsequent evolution of the nascent cluster can be modeled as an active dewetting process with cluster shape evolution driven by a balance between cluster surface tension, arising from both cell contractility and adhesion, and cluster viscous dissipation. The description of the physical mechanisms governing the spontaneous emergence of these intriguing three-dimensional clusters offers insight into SMC-related disorders.},

While normal lung function is maintained under these conditions, changes in mechanical stresses can have profound effects on the function of epithelial cells and therefore the function of the organ. In this review, we will describe the types of stresses and strains in the lungs, how these are transmitted, and how these may vary in human disease or animal models. Many approaches have been developed to better understand how cells sense and respond to mechanical stresses, and we will discuss these approaches and how they have been used to study lung epithelial cells in culture. Understanding how cells sense and respond to changes in mechanical stresses will contribute to our understanding of the role of lung epithelial cells during normal function and development and how their function may change in diseases such as acute lung injury, asthma, emphysema, and fibrosis.},

  abstract = {The cytoskeleton is generally visualized by light or electron microscopy as a meshwork of protein filaments that spans the space between the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane. In most cell types, this meshwork is formed by a three dimensional composite network of actin filaments, microtubules (MT), and intermediate filaments (IF) together with the host of proteins that bind to the sides or ends of these linear polymers. Cytoskeletal binding proteins regulate filament length, crosslink filaments to each other, and apply forces to the filaments. One approach to modeling the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and of cell in general is to consider the elements of the cytoskeleton as polymers, using experimental methods and theoretical models developed for traditional polymers but modified for the much larger, stiffer, and fragile biopolymers comprising the cytoskeleton. The presence of motor proteins that move actin filaments and microtubules also creates a new class of active materials that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and unconstrained by limitations of the fluctuation\textendash dissipation theorem. These active materials create rich opportunities for experimental design and theoretical developments. The degree to which the mechanics of live cells can usefully be modeled as highly complex polymer networks is by no means certain, and this article will discuss recent progress in quantitatively measuring cytoskeletal polymer systems and relating them to the properties of the cell.},

Recently, it has been proposed that in addition to matrix stiffness and ligand type, the degree of coupling of fibrous protein to the surface of the underlying substrate, that is, tethering and matrix porosity, also regulates stem cell differentiation. By modulating substrate porosity without altering stiffness in polyacrylamide gels, we show that varying substrate porosity did not significantly change protein tethering, substrate deformations, or the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stromal cells and marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Varying protein\textendash substrate linker density up to 50-fold changed tethering, but did not affect osteogenesis, adipogenesis, surface\textendash protein unfolding or underlying substrate deformations. Differentiation was also unaffected by the absence of protein tethering. Our findings imply that the stiffness of planar matrices regulates stem cell differentiation independently of protein tethering and porosity.},

Self-sustained turbulent motion in microbial suspensions presents an intriguing example of collective dynamical behavior among the simplest forms of life and is important for fluid mixing and molecular transport on the microscale. The mathematical characterization of turbulence phenomena in active nonequilibrium fluids proves even more difficult than for conventional liquids or gases. It is not known which features of turbulent phases in living matter are universal or system-specific or which generalizations of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations are able to describe them adequately. Here, we combine experiments, particle simulations, and continuum theory to identify the statistical properties of self-sustained meso-scale turbulence in active systems. To study how dimensionality and boundary conditions affect collective bacterial dynamics, we measured energy spectra and structure functions in dense Bacillus subtilis suspensions in quasi-2D and 3D geometries. Our experimental results for the bacterial flow statistics agree well with predictions from a minimal model for self-propelled rods, suggesting that at high concentrations the collective motion of the bacteria is dominated by short-range interactions. To provide a basis for future theoretical studies, we propose a minimal continuum model for incompressible bacterial flow. A detailed numerical analysis of the 2D case shows that this theory can reproduce many of the experimentally observed features of self-sustained active turbulence.},

  abstract = {Motile cilia project from the airway apical surface and directly interface with inhaled external environment. Due to cilia's nanoscale dimension and high beating frequency, quantitative assessment of their motility remains a sophisticated task. Here we described a robust approach for reproducible engineering of apical-out airway organoid (AOAO) of defined size. Propelled by exterior-facing cilia beating, the mature AOAO exhibited stable rotational motion when surrounded by Matrigel. We developed a computational framework leveraging computer vision algorithms to quantify AOAO rotation and validated its correlation with direct measurement of cilia motility. We further established the feasibility of using AOAO rotation to recapitulate and measure defective cilia motility caused by chemotherapy-induced toxicity and by CCDC39 mutations in cells from primary ciliary dyskinesia patient. We expect our rotating AOAO model and the associated computational pipeline to offer a generalizable framework to expediate modeling of and therapeutic development for genetic and environmental ciliopathies.},

Detailed descriptions of cell lineages and behaviors provide a powerful framework to elucidate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. To study the cellular basis of limb development, we imaged transgenic fluorescently-labeled embryos from the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis with multi-view light-sheet microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution over several days of embryogenesis. The cell lineage of outgrowing thoracic limbs was reconstructed at single-cell resolution with new software called Massive Multi-view Tracker (MaMuT). In silico clonal analyses suggested that the early limb primordium becomes subdivided into anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb-bud formation is associated with spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by preferential orientation of cell divisions along the proximal-distal growth axis. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic.},

  abstract = {Cell division plays an important role in animal tissue morphogenesis, which depends, critically, on the orientation of divisions. In isolated adherent cells, the orientation of mitotic spindles is sensitive to interphase cell shape and the direction of extrinsic mechanical forces. In epithelia, the relative importance of these two factors is challenging to assess. To do this, we used suspended monolayers devoid of ECM, where divisions become oriented following a stretch, allowing the regulation and function of epithelial division orientation in stress relaxation to be characterized. Using this system, we found that divisions align better with the long, interphase cell axis than with the monolayer stress axis. Nevertheless, because the application of stretch induces a global realignment of interphase long axes along the direction of extension, this is sufficient to bias the orientation of divisions in the direction of stretch. Each division redistributes the mother cell mass along the axis of division. Thus, the global bias in division orientation enables cells to act collectively to redistribute mass along the axis of stretch, helping to return the monolayer to its resting state. Further, this behavior could be quantitatively reproduced using a model designed to assess the impact of autonomous changes in mitotic cell mechanics within a stretched monolayer. In summary, the propensity of cells to divide along their long axis preserves epithelial homeostasis by facilitating both stress relaxation and isotropic growth without the need for cells to read or transduce mechanical signals.},

If not dealt with, the accumulation of stress and the resulting tissue deformation can pose a threat to tissue integrity and structure. Here we follow the time-course of events by which cells and tissues return to their preferred state following a mechanical perturbation.

While these have been shown to trigger mechanosensitive responses such as cell extrusion and differentiation, which span tens of minutes, little is known about how epithelia adapt to compression over shorter timescales. Here, using suspended epithelia, we uncover the immediate response of epithelial tissues to the application of in-plane compressive strains (5\textendash 80\%). We show that fast compression induces tissue buckling followed by actomyosin-dependent tissue flattening that erases the buckle within tens of seconds, in both mono- and multi-layered epithelia. Strikingly, we identify a well-defined limit to this response, so that stable folds form in the tissue when compressive strains exceed a `buckling threshold' of \textasciitilde 35\%. A combination of experiment and modelling shows that this behaviour is orchestrated by adaptation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton as it re-establishes tissue tension following compression. Thus, tissue pre-tension allows epithelia to both buffer against deformation and sets their ability to form and retain folds during morphogenesis.},

Forces applied through external stimuli or endogenous cellular events are balanced by the cells within the epithelium, resulting in the adjustment of internal tissue contractile stresses and tissue reorganization. Materials science and microengineering techniques can be combined to create controllable environments to study epithelial movement and mechanics. By modulating the cell\textendash material interface and by applying principles of active matter, key aspects of epithelial dynamics and mechanosensing mechanisms can be investigated. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we discuss epithelial tissues as active materials with particular rheological properties and active behaviours at different length scales. We highlight 2D and 3D materials for the study of epithelial dynamics and summarize key methods for the probing of epithelial mechanics. Tissue responses to mechanical stimuli are examined from the molecular level to the tissue level, and the effects of the shape, architecture and stiffness of the microenvironment are discussed.},

An important example is the mammalian inner cell mass, in which the primitive endoderm (PrE, founder of the yolk sac) physically segregates from the epiblast (EPI, founder of the fetus). While the molecular requirements have been well studied, the physical mechanisms determining spatial segregation between EPI and PrE remain elusive. Here, we investigate the mechanical basis of EPI and PrE sorting. We find that rather than the differences in static cell surface mechanical parameters as in classical sorting models, it is the differences in surface fluctuations that robustly ensure physical lineage sorting. These differential surface fluctuations systematically correlate with differential cellular fluidity, which we propose together constitute a non-equilibrium sorting mechanism for EPI and PrE lineages. By combining experiments and modeling, we identify cell surface dynamics as a key factor orchestrating the correct spatial segregation of the founder embryonic lineages.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

When grown in sparse culture with no cell-cell contacts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells show an abrupt change in spread area that occurs at a stiffness range around 3,000 Pa. No actin stress fibers are seen in fibroblasts on soft surfaces, and the appearance of stress fibers is abrupt and complete at a stiffness range coincident with that at which they spread. Upregulation of {$\alpha$}5 integrin also occurs in the same stiffness range, but exogenous expression of {$\alpha$}5 integrin is not sufficient to cause cell spreading on soft surfaces. Neutrophils, in contrast, show no dependence of either resting shape or ability to spread after activation when cultured on surfaces as soft as 2 Pa compared to glass. The shape and cytoskeletal differences evident in single cells on soft compared to hard substrates are eliminated when fibroblasts or endothelial cells make cell-cell contact. These results support the hypothesis that mechanical factors impact different cell types in fundamentally different ways, and can trigger specific changes similar to those stimulated by soluble ligands.

We found that new interfaces elongate in pulses correlated with periodic contractions of the surrounding cells. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility globally, or specifically in the cells around multicellular vertices, disrupted the rate and directionality of new interface assembly. Laser ablation indicated that new interfaces sustained greater tension than non-elongating ones. We developed a method to apply ectopic tension and found that increasing AP tension locally increased the elongation rate of new edges by more than twofold. Increasing dorsal-ventral tension resulted in vertex resolution perpendicular to the AP direction.

PEG hydrogels permissive towards cellular remodeling were fabricated using thiol-ene photopolymerization to incorporate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable crosslinks and CRGDS cell adhesion peptide. Time lapse microscopy, immunofluorescence imaging, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) demonstrated that iPSC-ECs formed vascular networks through mechanisms that were consistent with in vivo vasculogenesis and angiogenesis when cultured in PEG hydrogels. Migrating iPSC-ECs condensed into clusters, elongated into tubules, and formed polygonal networks through sprouting. Genes upregulated for iPSC-ECs cultured in PEG hydrogels relative to control cells on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) surfaces included adhesion, matrix remodeling, and Notch signaling pathway genes relevant to in vivo vascular development. Vascular networks with lumens were stable for at least 14days when iPSC-ECs were encapsulated in PEG hydrogels that were polymerized within the central channel of the microfluidic device.

Deciphering the process of tissue folding and applying this knowledge to engineer folded systems would significantly advance the field of tissue engineering. Although early studies focused on investigating the biochemical signaling events that occur during the folding process, the physical or mechanical aspects of the process have received increasing attention in recent years. In this review, we will summarize recent findings on the mechanical aspects of folding and introduce strategies by which folding can be controlled in vitro. Emphasis will be placed on the folding events triggered by mechanical effects at the cellular and tissue levels and on the different cell- and biomaterial-based approaches used to recapitulate folding. Finally, we will provide a perspective on the development of engineering tissue folding toward preclinical and clinical translation.

In this review, we will cover recent findings of the mechanical aspect of folding mechanisms, and introduce strategies to control the folding process in vitro. We will also provide a perspective on the future development of the field towards preclinical and clinical translation of various bio fabrication technologies.},

  abstract = {Cells act as building blocks of multicellular organisms, forming higher-order structures at different biological scales. Niches, tissues and, ultimately, entire organisms consist of single cells that remain in constant communication. Emergence of developmental patterns and tissue architecture thus relies on single cells acting as a collective, coordinating growth, migration, cell fate transitions and cell type sorting. For this, information has to be transmitted forward from cells to tissues and fed back to the individual cell to allow dynamic and robust coordination.},

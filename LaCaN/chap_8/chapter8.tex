\section{Introduction}\label{introduction5}}

Epithelial structures in biology exhibit a diverse range of shapes and sizes, including curved or folded forms. Understanding these structures can be complicated, particularly in the context of developmental biology. Interestingly, the etymology of the terms "development" and "complicated" provides insight into the importance of folding and unfolding processes. "Development" comes from "\textit{desvelopemens}," meaning "unfolding," which describes the morphogenesis of an organism. In contrast, "complicated" comes from "\textit{com-plicare}," meaning "folded together," which is fitting for describing the emergence of complex, folded structures in epithelial tissues.

By utilizing the MOLI tool, we can create 3D epithelial structures by inflating domes, thereby transforming a planar monolayer into a curved configuration. In this chapter, we will discuss how these structures can be made even more "complicated". By studying the mechanics of epithelial tissue, we have discovered that the dome can be deflated into folds by rapidly depressurizing it. We will explore the process of epithelial buckling and discuss how this knowledge has enabled us to transform domes into folded structures.

	\section{Rapid deflation produces a buckling
		instability}\label{rapid-deflation-produces-a-buckling-instability}}

In the preceding chapter, we observed that the domes exposed to a constant pressure would gradually inflate and eventually reach a steady state, which can be attributed cytoskeletal remodeling. Specifically, the original footprint area increased to areal strains exceeding 100\%, more than double the original area. Moreover, when subjected to cyclic stretching, we observed that rapid inflation-deflation cycles accumulated strains in the tissue. Given the precise control over pressure, we decided to expose the tissue to extreme rates of pressure, allowing no time for relaxation and leading to buckling instability.

By using the computational model, we were able to examine the mechanical effects of deflation on the digital dome at both tissue and cell scales. Our analysis revealed that active viscoelastic dissipation through cortical remodeling allowed the dome to achieve high strains. When we subjected the dome to cyclic stretching at rapid rates, we noticed a discrepancy between the actual and resting areas. This observation suggested that fast deflation could induce negative viscoelastic stress greater than active tensions, leading to buckling.

Our findings showed that digital domes gradually returned to a flat monolayer when deflated at a rate slower than the remodeling timescale. However, deflating the domes more quickly than the remodeling timescales resulted in buckling  (see fig \ref{fig_8_1}). Simulations revealed that the negative pressure was necessary for inducing buckling, which affected only rapidly deflating domes. This was due to negative stresses, as the pressure became negative while the curvature remained positive. In contrast, slowly deflating domes reached zero strain as the pressure approached zero.

To systematically test our hypothesis regarding the factors affecting buckling events, we designed experiments with pressure profiles consisting of three stages (see fig \ref{fig_8_2}). Firstly, we initiated a linear increase in pressure from 0 to 200 Pa over a period of 10 seconds. Secondly, we applied constant pressure for varying "hold times," which were chosen based on the timescales associated with actomyosin cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, we decreased the pressure to -50Pa at varying "deflation rates."

It is important to note that we relied on qualitative characterization of buckling events, assuming that smooth and continuous curvature of the monolayer indicates the absence of buckling. We performed the experiments for all conditions and quantified the data by tracking the fraction of domes that underwent buckling.

Our results showed that buckling occurred for all hold times, ranging from 6s to 600s, at the fastest deflation rate of 200 Pa/s. This confirmed the hypothesis that rapid deflation would induce compressive stresses and cause buckling (see fig \ref{fig_8_3} A-B). On the other hand, slow deflation at a rate of 0.2 Pa/s rarely led to buckling, regardless of the hold time (see fig \ref{fig_8_3} C-D). This suggests that the tissue can effectively remodel its cytoskeleton and adapt to drastic changes in area to avoid buckling.

As seen in previous experiments, longer "hold times" allowed for more cytoskeletal remodeling, resulting in higher strains and a higher likelihood of buckling, even for slower deflation rates. Results plotted in a phase diagram illustrates the trend: as hold time increases, buckling becomes more likely at faster deflation rates and less likely at slower deflation rates with a shorter hold time (see fig \ref{fig_8_3} E).

Interestingly, the data showed that domes with a 6s hold time had smaller strains compared to those with a 600s hold time, which is consistent with results from domes subjected to constant pressure (see fig \ref{fig_8_3} F). Strain increase requires time for the dome to remodel and balance active tension with the externally applied pressure. Despite a hold time of 6 seconds, we still observed buckling within the system. The expectation for this condition was to enable the inflation and deflation of the dome before any cytoskeletal remodeling could occur. We selected a 6-second hold time based on the imaging speeds; however, the inflation and deflation process was still too slow for the timescales of cytoskeletal remodeling.

It is important to note that we observed a wide variety of buckling patterns when examining midsections of the tissue through a line scan method. Some domes exhibited minor kinks in the folds, while others showed drastic buckling modes similar to those of plates.

\hypertarget{multiscale-buckling}{%
	\section{Multiscale buckling}\label{multiscale-buckling}}

The observation of tissue buckling was evident in the confocal line scan images. In order to gain a clearer understanding of the shape of the cells, we adapted a variation of MOLI for use with light sheet microscopy. The higher resolution 3D images of the dome revealed a variety of thicknesses of the cells, with thicker regions caused by the bulging of the nucleus and very thin regions at the cell periphery (see fig \ref{fig_8_6} B).

To further investigate the phenomenon of buckling, we repeated the experiments described in the previous section, with rapid deflation and a long hold time. We discovered additional features beyond tissue-scale buckling, including kinks and crimps at cellular and subcellular scales. Upon closer inspection, we classified three levels of buckling:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tissue
	\item Cellular
	\item Sub-cellular
\end{enumerate}

At the tissue scale, buckling was visible with cells collectively transitioning from a uniform curvature to a distorted shape (see fig \ref{fig_8_6} A). At this level, we observed cell deformation at a larger scale, including at the junctions between cells.

At shorter scales, we observed individual cells undergoing buckling (see fig \ref{fig_8_6} B). The buckling of the cell resulted in the cell doubling up around itself, with the apical side at the top. The length scale at which cell buckling occurred was much shorter than that observed at the tissue level. It appears as though the cell buckles as a single unit.

In some cases, buckling occurred at even shorter length scales, which we refer to as subcellular buckling, as the folds in the membrane were distinct from the cell level buckling. These folds occurred in the thinnest parts of the stretched cells, where the membrane buckled at much shorter wavelengths (see fig \ref{fig_8_6} C). Interestingly, these folds occurred on both the apical and basal sides of the cells.

In epithelial cells, the membrane is typically attached to the cortex through membrane-cortex attachment proteins such as ezrin, radixin, and moesin. It is reasonable to assume that the subcellular buckling observed in our experiments is due to actin cortex buckling. To confirm this, we imaged the actin cortex while the dome was undergoing buckling using SPY actin staining (see fig \ref{fig_8_6} D). Our results showed that the actin cortex followed the exact shape of the membrane during buckling.

We also observed that some domes did not appear to be buckling at the tissue scale, but were still exhibiting buckling at the cell or subcellular level (see fig \ref{fig_8_7}). ). These categories are not strictly separated, as we observed multiple instances of tissue, cell, and subcellular level buckling  (see fig \ref{fig_8_6} A).

\hypertarget{generating-epithelial-folds}{%
	\section{Generating epithelial
		folds}\label{generating-epithelial-folds}}

After optimizing the buckling conditions, we embarked on exploring epithelial folds. We have been imaging only the cross-section of the dome to capture the fast dynamics. We see the buckling in form of the squiggly lines. However, these buckling events are three-dimensional (see fig \ref{fig_8_3} B). During tissue buckling, a large area squeezed into original footprint area resulted in the formation of folds and wrinkles in the monolayer. Monitoring the base of the dome deflating, we observed that the tissue made contact with the substrate in certain regions first and others later. This led to the formation of folds in the regions where it made contact last (see fig \ref{fig_8_5} A-C).

To investigate if there was any pattern to these folds, we looked at spherical domes of various sizes. Broadly, we observed two types of folding patterns emerging (see fig \ref{fig_8_8}):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Accumulation along the periphery
	\item Folds in the middle
\end{enumerate}

For domes with a footprint diameter smaller than $\sim 110 \mu m$, we repeatedly observed that most of the buckling resulted in an accumulation around the periphery (see fig \ref{fig_8_5} A). The confocal timelapse from the base gave the impression of a donut-like structure, but three-dimensional imaging of the folds revealed a crescent-shaped fold like a croissant, taller on one side than the other. For larger domes with a footprint  diameter greater than $\sim 300 \mu m$, we observed more instances of domes forming a network of folds in the middle, with multiple folds connecting each other by forming junctions (see fig \ref{fig_8_5} C). Finally, for domes of intermediate size, we observed a mixture of accumulation and folds, although the proportion of folds along the periphery decreased (see fig \ref{fig_8_8}).

Interestingly, we observed the same folding patterns in our digital domes when performing the same deflation experiments (see fig \ref{fig_8_5} D). Larger digital domes produced more radial folds, and small digital domes formed an accumulation on the side. Intermediate-sized digital domes showed a mixture of both patterns.

\hypertarget{forming-predictable-folds}{%
	\section{Forming predictable folds}\label{forming-predictable-folds}}

We were intrigued by how variations in the geometry of the domes might influence the pattern formation of folds. While we observed that spherical domes of different sizes produced varying and intricate buckling patterns, their axis-symmetric shape made it challenging to predict the patterns accurately. To overcome this limitation, we decided to generate large digital domes of the same footprint area but with distinct geometries, including an ellipsoidal and a triangular shape. Remarkably, we found that the digital domes buckled into predictable patterns, with the ellipsoidal shape forming a line along the major axis and the triangular shape forming a Y junction fold.

In order to explore the effects of geometry on the formation of folds in epithelial structures, we conducted experiments using MOLI with ellipsoidal domes of varying sizes. Our observations revealed that larger ellipsoidal domes would buckle into a fold along their major axis, just as digital domes, while smaller ellipsoidal domes produced a similar peripheral accumulation as spherical domes (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} B). This suggests that only larger domes, regardless of their shape, possess the capability to produce folds in the middle.
 
To further explore the possibility of creating more complex folds, we decided to buckle a dome with a triangular shape, anticipating that the vertices of the triangle could push the buckling along the medians of the triangle (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} C). As expected, the domes did buckle into forming a Y-shaped network of the fold (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} D). We also repeated the triangular and ellipsoidal shapes with digital domes and found similar patterns (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} A-B).

Furthermore, as expected, we found that the triangular domes buckled into a Y-shaped network of folds that resembled the pattern observed in digital domes (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} D). The timelapse of buckling indicated that the vertices of the triangular domes  pushed the buckling along the medians of the triangle (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} C).

We observed that the folds exhibited variability in terms of stability, with some dissipating into the monolayer while others remained intact and even formed attachments with each other. These folded structures were stable for several hours and could be imaged for over 12 hours (see fig \ref{fig_8_7} E-F). Interestingly, when immediately inflated, these folds would unfurl themselves into a dome again.

Our results suggest that the MOLI system could provide a novel way of generating folds, with potential applications in tissue engineering. By controlling a few mechanical parameters such as geometry and pressure, it is possible to produce folds of predictable patterns.

	\section{Summary and Discussion}\label{summary-and-discussion-1}}

We utilized our device to generate dome from a flat monolayer then transform it into folds, alongside investigating the buckling response in relation to actin remodeling timescales. We discovered that buckling occurs at various scales, starting from the tissue level down to the actin cortex of individual cells, and is triggered when deflation occurs more rapidly than actin can remodel. We then explored the patterns of folding that emerge from different sized and shaped domes, and proposed a new method of creating controlled folds from planar monolayer. With the aid of computational models, we demonstrated the engineering potential of the dome system to produce structured folds by manipulating the geometry and pressure.

As mentioned earlier, mechanical instabilities are ubiquitous in biological systems, and the phenomenon of buckling has been observed in MDCK epithelial monolayers through various methods, such as growth in confinement or direct application of compression \cite{wyatt2020,trushko2020}. Wyatt et al. demonstrated that compressive stress greater than 35\% strain can cause epithelial monolayers to buckle out of plane, and showed that active contractility can recover the out-of-plane deformation within tens of seconds.

Our study, on the other hand, is the first to offer visual insights into the minute details of the buckling process and its implications for tissue architecture at multiple scales.

From a mechanistic perspective, our result are a consequence of the hierarchical structure of the epithelial tissue, which comprises various components that sustain deformations and forces at different levels. Notably, the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in defining the shape of cells and tissues at multiple scales \cite{clarke2021}. Additionally, a cell monolayer can be considered as an assembly of cells with their own surface tension and material properties, indicating a material with different length scales would buckle at different length scales. Therefore, if there is a local weakness in a cell or subcellular feature, it is expected to locally buckle. For instance, we only observed subcellular-level buckling in very thin cells while overall tissue does not buckle.

Furthermore, the short-wavelength folds resulting from subcellular buckling are intriguing to consider. It is worth noting that actin buckling is not a new phenomenon in the field, and there are minimal models of actin filaments with myosin motors on a lipid membrane demonstrating that myosin-induced contraction leads to actin filament buckling \cite{murrell2012, costa2002,  wang2019}. In membrane-actin droplets, researchers have reported multiple modes in the form of buckling and wrinkling, depending on the thickness \cite{kusters2019}. Interestingly, they found that thin shells undergo buckling and thin shells produce wrinkles in the membrane but not in actin, which could indicate different modes of buckling within a cell.

In the context of tissue-scale buckling, our results can be understood in terms of modes of buckling in thin shells. Our computational model suggests that the cortex behaves like a hyperelastic material at short timescales, as in our case by the rate at which we are deflating these tissues. Similar results would be obtained if we repeated the experiment with elastic shells. The literature on thin shell buckling reveals similar aspects, such as the folds and patterns that emerge when different sized shells buckle (ref).

The slenderness, defined as the ratio of dome radius to thickness, intuitively guides the different modes of buckling. Thin shells with high slenderness would lead to a higher mode of buckling compared to thicker shells. However, our experiments go beyond understanding the system and show that we can program folds by minimally controlling two parameters: geometry and pressure. For non-spherical domes, anisotropic stresses are observed along the axes of the elliptical footprint for ellipsoidal domes (ref). These stresses can orient the folding in a particular direction to generate a programmed fold, such as Y junctions on the sides of a rectangular footprint.

In summary, this thesis presents a novel experimental system that allows us to inflate epithelial domes and deflate them into tubes. We demonstrate that the timescales of actomyosin cytoskeleton remodeling play a key role in this transformation. By controlling the geometry of the epithelia and the rate of deflation, we show that we can engineer epithelial folds of desired geometry.

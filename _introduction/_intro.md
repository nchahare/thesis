The center focus of this thesis is epithelial monolayers. From the materialist perspective, these monolayers are endlessly fascinating. They are shape changing, self healing, continuously deform or jam depending on the requirement. They are the simplest system conceptually to understand the wider world of morphogenesis. This introduction is a primer to all the topics relevant to the thesis. First I will give a brief introduction to the epithelial tissue itself and its key components along side a snippet of its role in disease and development. Then I will give a summary of morphogenesis and how we can think of epithelia as an active material and what are the historical ways of modelling it. Finally, I will conclude with the emerging field of bottom up morphogenesis, where researchers are reconstructing the biological systems from scratch.

## Summary

We have developed a microfluidic chip to generate 3D curved epithelia, utilizing a multilevel device consisting of two layers separated by a porous membrane. Seeding cells on the membrane in the bottom channel allowed for dome formation closer to the microscope objective, enabling high-quality confocal imaging. Hydrostatic pressure was used to control pressure under the dome dynamically, allowing for monitoring of cells and tissue behavior. Additionally, we developed imaging strategies to capture dynamics of these 3D structures faster using line scanning mode of confocal microscope or light sheet microscope.

The device is able to measure forces and build epithelial domes. However, it is not only restricted to domes, we could imagine building even more with it such are complex shapes and network of the tubes or different co-culture systems. For example, this could be easily extended in replacing MDCK cells to any other cell line where there is enough of the cell-cell adhesion to form inflated structures.

For instance, we could apply this experimental system with stem cells in investigating the relationship between curvature and pressure. As it is of great interest in the field of developmental biology. Past studies have shown that there is a close connection with curvature and tension. This system could present an alternative to traditional systems of micropipetting or puncturing the system.

However, this device could also be useful in establishing co-culture systems. Because of the original design was based on a lung on chip co- culture, we have found its application in creating co-culturing systems such as fibroblasts and cancer spheriods. The two channels separated by a barrier offers a transwell like setup which is widely used in the field. For example, immunofilteration. Or this can be extended to use of organoid system where we can put 2D organoids and open up the lumen with patterning and pressure. We could have organoids in the bottom channel which can be filled up with matrix too for better growth of the organoids. While having lumen accessible for pressure control. We think there are endless avenues to pursue in different cell systems  with control over pressure, biochemical signaling, micropatterning and high resolution imaging. 

Another aspect of the device could be to closely at the dynamics of the cell cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. This device offers capabilities of stretching cells 400% of their original size. This unprecedented control over the stretching allows for using epithelial cell lines labeled with different cytoskeletal filaments or components to examine the effects of stretch and curature. For example, we could use MDCK cell labeled with cadherin to see the response of cell-cell junctions to extreme levels of stretching. There is a lot of information on the stretching of the individual filaments or molecules. Characterized response however, the cell stretching is limited to adherent cells stretching to 10-25%. Exceptionally, system developed by Harris et al. could stretch a lot but it is limited to 2D monolayers and lacks the control over curvature. We expect this device to open avenues in characterization of cytoskeletal components to large strains and measure the tension.

As demonstrated in previous studies, the most intriguing aspect of the system is that complex materials such as epithelial tissue, in order to maintain mechanical equilibrium, must adopt a spherical cap shape for a circular footprint. This uniform curvature and pressure imply uniform tension, independent of tissue material properties (Latorre et al., 2018; Marín-Llauradó et al., 2022). The tissue tension can be easily measured by applying Laplace's law for spherical cap domes. However, in the case of non-spherical geometry, there would be anisotropic stresses that would require a computational model, such as curved monolayer stress microscopy, to solve an inverse problem to go from geometry to forces (Marín-Llauradó et al., 2022). In this thesis, we limit ourselves to measuring tissue tensions in spherical domes. 

At the same time, we could utilize other techniques to infer forces


## Device

There are constant improvements in the device since the moment of its conception. The device started out as a device compatible with only inverted microscopes. Then for imaging fast moving subcellular features we adapted the device for light sheet microscope.

There could be possible modification that can be incorporated for certain applications. For example, the device could be adapted for high  throughput experiments where we could have pressure application for longer terms and monitor state of epithelia with immunofluorescence staining.

Another aspect we would like to do is to get rid of the membrane, where we can 








The geometry of the domes is primarily controlled by the adhesion protein pattern, but delamination can still occur. In spontaneous domes, circular footprints were found to be the most common (Tanner, Frambach, and Misfeldt 1983). This was the reason the researchers thought that this circular footprint

while domes formed around sharp corners can blunt themselves through delamination (Latorre et sal. 2018). This must be taken into consideration when creating specific geometries.

Tissue tension and adhesion forces also interact with each other. In MDCK suspended monolayer, it is seen that cell-cell junctions are stronger than cell-substrate adhesion (A. R. Harris et al. 2012), so if tension at the base of the dome exceeds the adhesion forces, it can lead to detachment and delamination.

Furthermore, we have unintentionally developed a peeling system that enables us to observe tissue detachment from the substrate. If the dome retains its spherical shape, we can calculate the necessary forces for breaking cell-substrate adhesion and identify the contribution of focal adhesion molecular components.

This system provides a novel approach for testing material properties and probing mechanics at the tissue scale, allowing for simultaneous high-quality imaging and monitoring of cytoskeletal components and the nucleus. Additionally, we can create a 3D tissue with controlled lumen pressure, providing a well-controlled protocol that is suitable for replicating curvature-pressure-tension conditions in various cell lines, not just MDCK cells. However, our primary focus is on comprehending the mechanics of epithelial tissue under controlled pressure.

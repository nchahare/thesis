# chapter 6

protein patterning part

In the spontaneous dome system, the top surface was accessible for treatments and microcontact printing. However, in out case we have a completely sealed device; thus forcing us to use the photopatterning technique PRIMO. Briefly, we coat the surface with PLL and then SVA PEG chains. On shinning blue light the selective regions can be cleaved and would be exposed to adhesion promoting protein. We used fibronectin for the experiments in this thesis. However, other proteins such as vitronectin and collagen can be coated too.

We would coat the membrane using inverted microscope, where laser has to focus on membrane further away from the glass. We found that the primo technique would coat all the surfaces it passes through glass, both sides of the membrane. This could be the reason for the domes not forming in earlier case. Because of the coating on other side and pores of the membrane being big, we saw cells filtering through the holes blocking pressure application.

Pressure control part

switch the sentences
easy
15ml reservior


Imaging 

delete the green part
use dome's midsection instead of the dome
rewrite is necessary
switch around, say material testing will be impossible if we can not the image faster
so we come up with coolest ever thing

# chapter 7

constitutive equation part
this way it is impossible for us to measure tension at low strains.

we need to work on the explaining the model properly.

last section: 
resting area is invented. i think he didnt understand it
in summary section
we should say that for short timescales it is like a spring
and long it is dashpot .read the otger campas paper and copy the explanation



title just buckling no instability

rewrite the second paragraph


we selected 6s... however, 10s ramp to inflate the dome plus 6s hold time, already gives the system time  to remodel and when we buckle it buclkles very little.

shorter than this was not possible with imaging and inflation of the domes

here, there's interesting tit bit as the pressure decreases when dome continues to inflate

generating folds

we need to say the diameter not the area

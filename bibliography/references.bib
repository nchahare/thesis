	abstract = {During development, organisms interact with their natural habits while undergoing morphological changes, yet it remains unclear whether the interplay between developing systems and their environments impacts animal morphogenesis. Here, we use the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis as a developmental model to uncover a mechanistic link between organism size, shape and behavior. Using quantitative live imaging, including extensive behavioral profiling, combined with molecular and biophysical experiments, we demonstrate that the muscular hydraulic machinery that controls body movement directly drives larva-polyp morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, size and shape development are differentially controlled by antagonistic muscles. A simple theoretical model shows how a combination of slow-priming and fast-pumping pressures generated by muscular hydraulics acts as a global mechanical regulator that coordinates tissue remodeling. Altogether, our findings illuminate how dynamic behavioral modes in the environment can be harnessed to drive morphogenetic trajectories, establishing ethology as a critical component of organismal morphogenesis – termed ethology of morphogenesis.},

# Bottom up morphogenesis

## Learn by building

The mechanics and biology of epithelial tissues are complex, with mechano-chemical signaling and multiscale behavior all intertwined. The lens of active material has been instrumental in illuminating the role of molecular elements in undergoing shape changes during morphogenesis. Mechanistic understanding has been enhanced with new mathematical tools and advanced microscopy, enabling measurement of the forces involved in tissues.

The traditional and successful method for studying mechanics has been to deconstruct the system one component or parameter at a time. By manipulating genes or disrupting cellular processes, we can observe how mechanics change. This perturbative method allows for the alteration of biological systems at various levels, from molecular to tissue (see Figure 4.1).

However, studying systems like organoids or embryos can only provide limited physical insights into the topological transitions of these structures, as experimental systems have limited physical control and ability to measure forces. An alternative approach is to learn by actively performing morphogenesis or reconstructing biological structures from their basic components.

\caption{\label{fig_4_1} This is a conceptual representation of two approaches to understanding mechanics - reconstruction (bottom-up) and deconstruction (top-down). In reality, they are not separate from each other. These methods inform each other, where past top-down research guides new reconstruction, and new engineered cells or tissues further the understanding of the field in innovative directions.


For years, researchers have broken down biological systems into approachable parts - tissues, cells, proteins - in order to understand the behavior of each component. However, combining existing knowledge of these parts to recreate novel experimental systems could reveal the basic building blocks and effects of scale. This approach would complement top-down approaches in developmental biology. Synthetic biology, a perfect example of reconstruction, seeks to recreate life at various scales, from synthetic proteins to entire cells, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the indispensable components of life.

As active agents exist at every scale, emergent properties can appear at higher scales. Thus, it is essential to focus on higher scales or work with collectives of cells. This reminds me of the example of cars and traffic: Imagine you know the behavior of all individual car components, but this information is not sufficient to understand the behavior of traffic flow. This requires a higher level of analysis. Similarly, biological structures exhibit numerous collective behaviors, such as jamming, nematic order, instabilities, or self-organization (Trepat et al., 2018).

Recreating structures from scratch also provides an opportunity to understand the role of physics at different scales. In the spirit of D'Arcy Thompson, we can explore the fundamental properties of matter in biological structures. For instance, we can study the role of surface tension in guiding the shape of cellular aggregates or lumens. In this work, we focus on the mesoscale structures of epithelia. \((\sim 10-10^4 \mu m)\).  

We present our efforts to engineer an epithelial structure with a controlled microenvironment that is sensitive to self-organization and mechanical instabilities. The following sections will describe the ways of creating these structures from minimal ingredients.

Matthew Good's commentary provides an insightful perspective on the complexity involved in building cells from interacting molecules. Meanwhile, Xavier Trepat argues that a bottom-up approach does not fully explain the emergent behavior of higher-level structures and emphasizes the need for constructing tissues at the mesoscale. Trepat uses the analogy of traffic jams to illustrate the importance of considering the collective behavior of cells in tissue engineering \cite{good2018}.

Thompson writes,’...to seek not for ends but for antecedents is the way of the physicists, who finds causes in what he has learned to recognize as fundamental properties, or inseparable concomitants, or unchanging laws, of matter and of energy.” \cite{thompson1979}
## How to build epithelial structures?

Before embarking on the construction of an epithelial structure, it is important to consider the desired form and function. Despite the diversity in the shapes and functions of epithelia, certain elementary shapes can be seen in many cases, resulting from the interplay between physical forces and biochemical signaling. Examples of such shapes include spherical blastocysts, ellipsoidal embryos, or cylindrical vessels.

After considering the desired form and function of an epithelial structure, established cell lines are selected and synthetic structures are constructed using various techniques, such as geometry control and localized folding, as discussed in the \ref{mechanobiology} section. The resulting structures can be further studied to understand the interplay between physical forces and biochemical signaling, as well as their potential applications in various biological systems.

### Controlling geometry and physical forces



From an engineering perspective, scaffolding is a commonly used approach for constructing synthetic epithelial structures. Scaffolds can be generated through 3D printing or microfabrication techniques, and cells can then be seeded onto the scaffold to attain the desired shape \cite{torras2018}. This method allows for the creation of a well-controlled microenvironment for the cells in terms of geometry, stiffness, adhesion proteins, and cell culture media. Structures generated through this approach can be utilized to investigate tissue behavior in response to forces and curvature.

In a recent study by Dessalles et al., endothelial cells were cultured to form a micro-vessel using a hydrogel with a cylindrical hole. The hydrogel and cells were housed in a microfluidic device that controlled pressure and flow in the vessel, and the authors were able to examine the role of hydrogel poroelastic properties in regulating the dynamics of the vessel. Another exciting study demonstrated the potential of epithelial tissues to form shape-programmable materials by using a collagen scaffold that underwent a solid to fluid transition \cite{mailand2022}.

Scaffolds can also be designed to dynamically change their shape. For example, a cell monolayer on a flexible membrane can alter its curvature \cite{blonski2021}, and a combination of stretching and unstretching a cell-laden hydrogel can produce distinctive folds and patterns \cite{chan2018}. In some cutting-edge studies, researchers have utilized 4D bioprinting, where 3D printed objects undergo transformation over time. For instance, a flat hydrogel sheet containing endothelial cells and photo-crosslinking can be transformed into a tube \cite{zhang2020}.


### Manipulating biochemical signaling

Another approach to constructing epithelial structures involves controlling biochemical signaling to induce shape transformation. This approach utilizes natural processes in embryo morphogenesis, such as apical constriction in ventral furrow formation or cell jamming in the normal elongation of the zebrafish. Optogenetic tools, such as Rho signaling, can be used to induce localized apical constriction with spatiotemporal control \cite{izquierdo2018}. This technique can also be applied to other proteins, such as Shroom3, to induce synthetic morphogenesis in neural organoids \cite{martinez-ara2022} (see Fig. 4.3C).

Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction is another crucial aspect of the tissue folding process. Hughes et al. demonstrated that cell clusters can remodel the matrix to create oriented stresses that lead to budding in tissues \cite{hughes2018} (see Fig. 4.3B). By controlling the location and density of these cell clusters, it is possible to manipulate the curvature of the epithelia. Mesenchymal condensation serves as a folding template for the final tissue structure \cite{palmquist2022, shyer2017} (see Fig. 4.3B).

The microenvironment plays a critical role in providing vital signals to tissues and can be manipulated to activate specific cellular functions. Microfluidic techniques can deliver appropriate morphogen gradients to the tissue with precise timing \cite{hofer2021}. In vivo, multiple morphogens often act simultaneously. For instance, during neural tube development, there is an opposing gradient of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP). With microfluidic devices, stable gradients can be generated, even in opposite directions \cite{demers2016}, thus mimicking symmetry-breaking events and directional neural tube patterning (see Fig. 4.3D).

Moreover, genetic engineering of specific cells can be utilized to control signaling. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be programmed to express SHH \cite{cederquist2019} (see Fig. 4.3E). Mixing these cells with others could result in a polarized organoid and a patterned cerebral organoid.

### Exploiting mechanical instabilities

Morphogenesis, the process of shaping and formation of biological structures, often involves spontaneous pattern formation or symmetry-breaking events (ishihara2018). These processes are often dictated by mechanical instabilities, which can lead to large deformations in soft matter systems. In material science, these instabilities are typically seen as problematic as they cause rapid breakage. However, in soft matter, large deformations can lead to interesting topological transformations, providing an opportunity for engineers to exploit these instabilities in the development of new actuators or soft robots (reviewed in pal2021).

The significance of mechanical instabilities was foreseen by D'Arcy Thompson in his comparison of fluid splashes to hydroids. He wrote that the shapes of a potter's cup, glass blower's bulb, and biological structures are simply glorified splashes formed slowly under conditions of restraint that enhance or reveal their mathematical symmetry (thompson1979). This conjecture has been confirmed through numerous quantitative studies on various systems, including ripples in leaves and wrinkles in the brain (liang2009; karzbrun2018).

There are various instabilities associated with solids and fluids. For example, the Rayleigh-Plateau instability explains why a fluid stream breaks into smaller packets, driven by the fluid's tendency to minimize its surface area due to surface tension. The same instability can arise when fluid is surrounded by an elastic medium, instead of air, provided the surface tensions can overcome the elastic stresses, leading to budding as observed in alveologenesis in human mammary tissue (fernandez2021). However, as tissues are active viscoelastic materials, the timescales of these instabilities change, slowing down to hours instead of milliseconds in water droplets.

There are several types of mechanical instabilities associated with solids and fluids, including Rayleigh-Plateau instability, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, viscous coiling and folding, and large-scale wrinkling and buckling (gallaire2017; kourouklis2018). In this study, we aim to harness these instabilities to recreate epithelial structures.

Compressive stresses are one of the most common ways to induce mechanical instabilities in solids. These stresses can occur in biological systems as a result of differential growth, swelling, or morphogen gradients and can lead to various forms of instabilities, including wrinkling, creasing, and buckling. Buckling occurs when a thin sheet is subjected to in-plane compressive stress, and if the stress is above a critical value, the sheet undergoes out-of-plane deformation instead of in-plane shrinkage. In contrast, wrinkling and creasing occur in similar compressive stresses, but the thin sheet is typically supported by a compliant substrate.

The creation of biological tissues in vitro has been a subject of great interest in the field of tissue engineering. To reproduce the characteristics of these tissues, researchers have turned to the use of hydrogels. These materials can be mechanically and chemically manipulated to simulate the behavior of biological matrices, which provide support for epithelial structures.

One of the ways in which hydrogels can be used to recreate the behavior of biological tissues is through the application of physical stress. For example, swelling of the hydrogel can cause it to undergo large volumetric changes, producing crease-like patterns on the surface. If the hydrogel is constrained at the bottom, these creases can become permanent. Alternatively, if the hydrogel is supported by another flexible material, such as another hydrogel or an elastic substrate, the stresses produced during swelling will result in a wrinkling instability. These instabilities are important for understanding the formation of a variety of structures, including the gyrification of the brain cortex.

In a study by Tallinen et al. (2016), the gyrification of the brain cortex was replicated through the programming of materials to produce wrinkling (tallinen2016). The researchers created a synthetic brain with an inner core of an inert elastomer and an outer layer of a swellable elastomer. On swelling, the outer layer produced folds that closely matched the process of gyrification.

Similar mechanisms have been observed in other systems undergoing differential growth, such as the embryonic airway epithelium and the branching of lungs and intestinal villi. These findings highlight the potential of hydrogels as a tool for understanding the physical mechanisms underlying tissue development. However, it is worth noting that the mechanisms described here are the subject of ongoing research and debate in the field of developmental biology.

The ability to recreate biological tissue growth conditions in vitro has been made possible through the use of hydrogels. Researchers have discovered that by mechanically and chemically controlling the hydrogel, they can generate desired mechanical instabilities (dervaux2012). This can be accomplished through the swelling or pre-stretching of the gel, or by manually applying compressive stresses.

One way to simulate growth is through the direct stretching or compression of the gel. Chan et al. (2018) showed that the patterns produced can be controlled by modulating the shear modulus of the hydrogel with the epithelial layer and stretch (chan2018). By pre-stretching the hydrogel before seeding cells, they were able to produce folded patterns with different wavelengths depending on the type of pre-stretching applied (uniaxial or biaxial).

The mechanical information of the hydrogel or substrate can also be encoded with flexibility. This can be achieved through the tension produced by the cells in a pre-stretched membrane (tomba2022), or through stretching the epithelial layer without the matrix (fouchard2020). Another type of instability in bilayers is delaminated buckling, which is often observed in thin film delamination in furniture. This can be induced through compressive stresses created during growth or collective tension. Recent studies have shown that growing epithelia confined in a sphere undergo delaminated buckling after reaching a critical growth-induced stress (trusko2020), or through intercellular stresses (oyama2021) or by placing a biofilm on top of the epithelial monolayer (cont2020).

The formation of the ventral furrow in the drosophila embryo can also be considered as a buckling event. Although there are multiple explanations for this phenomenon, recent studies have shown that the instability leading to the fold is caused by embryo-level forces (guo2022; fierling2022).

It is noteworthy that there is currently only one established method for directly applying compressive stresses to suspended epithelial tissue. The Lab of Guillaume Charras has developed a technique using a cell-laden collagen gel sandwiched between two rods, where the gel is digested with collagenase to create a suspended monolayer. Through extensive experimentation, they have observed that the compression of more than 35% strain produces transient buckling events (wyatt2020). Importantly, the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in buffering deformations in this system.

## Tissue hydraulics

### Hydraulic control of tissue patterning

In this thesis, we focus on the role of hydraulic pressure in morphogenesis. It has been well established in the field of developmental biology that fluid pressure plays a significant role in lumen expansion. For instance, in the mouse embryo, cell aggregates form small fluid cavities in intercellular junctions, which grow and coalesce into a large lumen, breaking the symmetry of the embryo, due to the presence of an osmotic pressure gradient (dumortier2019; reviewed by torres-sanchez2021). This process is powered by the pumping of ions and water by the cells, which generates pressure in the fluid-filled cavities, ultimately leading to the formation of spherical embryos. The relationship between pressure, curvature, and surface tension can be described by Laplace's law.
$$ \sigma = \frac{\Delta P R}{2} $$
The shape that is created under pressure depends on the material properties of the tissue. For example, a homogeneous material would create a uniform curvature, such as a spherical shape, while an anisotropic tissue with oriented cells would result in various shapes, such as cylinders or ellipsoids (stokkermans2021). An interesting example of this phenomenon can be seen in the lobed epithelium of lizard lungs, which resembles the shape of a stress ball. Palmer et al. (2021) propose that the smooth muscle network functions as a mesh that constrains the epithelium, much like the outer layer of a stress ball. Upon the application of pressure, the epithelium inflates in the regions between the gaps in the muscles.

For embryos, an increase in pressure results in an increase in tension and stretching of the cells. Once a certain threshold is reached, the cell junctions may leak, causing a reduction in luminal pressure and shrinkage of the embryonic cavity. This system of pressure regulation through leakage acts as a mechanism for size regulation (chan2019). At the same time, it polarizes the embryo and promotes cell segregation and fate specification (reviewed by chan2020).

Similar coalescence and lumen coarsening have been observed in other systems, such as the zebrafish gut, otic vesicle, and salivary glands (schliffka2019). The pressure can also be generated through secretion of the matrix, as seen in the case of the drosophila hindgut with mucins (syed2012), or through the secretion of hyaluronic acid in the formation of ear canals in zebrafish otic vesicles (munjal2021). Despite numerous in vivo experiments, there are very few systems in which epithelial tissue can be subjected to controlled shape and size in vitro.

### Mechanics of domes

Many of the morphogenetic events are called doming because the shape vaguely represents domes. For instance, doming of the retina in the eye or zebrafish embryo, or doming during duct formation of mammary or salivary glands. There are typically two mechanisms for these: first, an accumulation of the cells or matrix to create curvature; and second, trans-epithelial transport causing hydraulic pressure-driven shape change. The second kind of domes is remarkable as they mimic various lumenized epithelia in vivo.

This is the most pertinent system to the thesis. I would briefly go into the historical developments in dome mechanics.

Fluid-filled dome formation in epithelial tissue culture has been recorded since 1933 (cameron1953). After several decades alongside the development of cell culture techniques, microscopy, and MDCK cell line, in 1968, Leighton and colleagues observed that the confluent MDCK cell monolayers formed hemispherical blisters (domes) (leighton1969). They observed that these are different from renal tubules because the apical surface, with microvilli, was facing outwards. They saw that these fluid-filled structures are dynamically changing size and curvature. They would burst to deflate and leak fluid out in the medium. Later they could heal and form the dome again. Later, other cell lines derived from mammalian and amphibian kidneys were often observed to form domes too (dulbecco1980, leighton1981)

Now the mechanism is clear as the epithelial cells perform critical barrier function alongside controlling the transepithelial flow of ions and water. It was shown that hindering sodium-potassium ion pumping reduces the likelihood of domes. Thus, on forming a confluent monolayer the cells perform their function of pumping ions from apical to basal direction. If the substrate is solid and impermeable the tissue accumulates enough pressure to delaminate and form a spherical structure.

Most domes observed have been spherical and circular in footprint, indicating uniform tension across the dome. This can be explained by considering the dome as a thin shell under pressure, similar to a bubble, and following Laplace's law. Early studies attempted to infer tension through geometry and pressure measurement (tanner1983), finding that the pressure was of the same order as physiological vessels.

One study (popowicz1986) identified a "dome curve" when the frequency of domes was plotted against size, observing three classes of domes in terms of size. Smaller domes were observed to swell and increase in size. It was also suggested that there could be different subpopulations of MDCK cells. In the 1990s, many strains were characterized that formed different inflated structures, ranging from normal domes to tubules (klebe1995). One cell line, called super dome MDCK, formed larger domes.

Despite research into ion transport, hormone signaling, the role of tight junctions, and external shear stress, the understanding of the mechanics of domes and pressure has remained stagnant due to the lack of tools for measuring tension, pressure, and controlling the shape and size of these structures.

The work of Ernest Latorre in our laboratory has led to the development of a unique system for controlling the size of domes and studying the relationship between tension and pressure (latorre2018). By utilizing protein patterning techniques, Latorre was able to create non-adhesive circular regions on soft PDMS gel, which, when seeded with MDCK cells, led to the formation of domes. The gel was embedded with beads to allow for the calculation of traction forces and pressures exerted by the monolayer. This system allowed for a deeper understanding of the rheology of tissue and the role of the cytoskeleton. Latorre observed that stretching the actin cortex leads to dilution, and that tension reaches a stable value regardless of strain. He also observed the surprising phenomenon of superelasticity, where cells are heterogeneously stretched in the dome when tension is uniform. To further understand the role of actin and keratin bundles in providing superelasticity, Latorre developed a vertex model.

Ariadna Marin-Llaurado extended Latorre's work by examining domes of varying sizes and shapes. This study found that different-sized spherical domes have similar tensions, and that pressure is compensated according to curvature. Marin-Llaurado and colleagues couldn't rely on a simple formula for tension calculation, and found that tension in non-spherical domes is non-uniform (marin-llaurado2022). They used confocal microscopy to map dome curvature and calculated stresses computationally using a novel method called cMSM (curved Monolayer Stress Microscopy). The results showed that cells tended to align along the principal stress direction.

The mechanics of osmotic and hydraulic gradients are also crucial to understand. Chaudhary et al. demonstrated that kidney cells act like a mechanobiological pump (choudhury2022). Using a two-layer microfluidic chip, the team was able to measure and apply pressure differences across an epithelial monolayer and observe that the tissue acted like a mechanical pump that stalls at high pressure. Remarkably, they discovered that diseased kidney cells pump in a different direction than healthy ones. They were able to control both osmotic and hydraulic pressure. Another study by Ishida-Ishihara et al. investigated the connection between osmotic pressure and extracellular matrix swelling (Ishida-Ishihara, 2020). The researchers found that osmotic gradients trigger Aquaporin transport channels, leading to dome formation through Matrigel swelling. However, these domes are gel-filled structures that differ from fluid-filled domes.

MDCK domes provide a model system for studying transport, cell fate, and tissue dynamics with a curvature. However, control over luminal pressure in these structures remains a challenge.

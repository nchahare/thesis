## Preface
## Introduction
1. **Epithelial tissue:** Physiological role of epithelia. (very brief)
	Box: for cell components and key players.
2. **Epithelial morphogenesis:** In vivo, tissue development and factors which play big roles. Morphogen gradients and physical forces such as pressure and tension.
3. **Epithelial mechanics:** Discussion on the form and function debate and dialectical need for forces.
	Box: forces involved in morphogenesis
4. **Bottom up morphogenesis:** Importance of mechanics and past efforts to understand biological systems bottom up. Introduce folding, buckling and wrinkling. Tools used in engineering epithelia and microfluidics. Learn by building. 
5. Motivation for the thesis. Isolate factors such as pressure and tension in 3D epithelia. Need to have a system where we can deform the material and measure the forces acting on it.(very brief).

## Aims of the thesis
*General aim of the thesis*
Study the mechanics of epithelial layers subjected to controlled pressure and tension.
*Specific aims of the thesis*
General aims are divided into specific goals:
1. Review the literature on engineering epithelia, and the effect of physical forces such as pressure and tension on morphogenesis.
2. Develop a new technology to control shape, size, and forces in three-dimensional epithelial monolayer.
3. Study the rheology of pressurized epithelial structure.
4. Explore the role of mechanics in formation of epithelial folds.

# Conclusions and Future perspective

The main conclusions are following:

1. We have developed a novel microfluidics based system for generating 3D epithelia. Using micropatterning technique, PRIMO, we could create the non-adhesive region from which epithelial monolayer can detach and inflate into a dome.
2. MOLI was used to probe the mechanics of epithelial domes subjected to constant pressure. We found that dome reaches steady state after five minutes for applying pressure. These experiments revealed a non-monotonous tension-strain response which is because of the geometric constraints.
3. Constitutive response of the epithelial tissue show that the domes exhibit an initial increase in tension with strain, tending to a tensional plateau at high strains. This is consistent with earlier studies in which the epithelia were shown to exhibit superelastic behavior.
4. Dynamic material testing of domes with range of inflation/deflation rates show that the active viscoelasticity of cortical network directs epithelial rheology.
5. A complimentary model, developed by Adam Ouzeri, enables us to understand different timescales involved in the tissue stretching process. 
6. The epithelial tissue behaves like an active viscoelastic fluid, which behaves like a hyperelastic material at faster rates and viscoelastic material at slower scales.
7. We show that the rapid deflation, faster than the remodeling timescales would lead to buckling instability.
8. The buckling occurs at multiple scales from subcellular level to tissue level. They differ in the characteristic length of the folds. Shortest one is for membrane cortex buckling, and longest for tissue scale.
9. The different sized spherical domes create different patterns. The smaller domes  buckle into a fold along their periphery and larger ones tend to create a network of folds in the center.
10. The folds can be programmed by controlling the shape of the dome. Elliptical domes produce a fold along the major axis. Triangular domes produce a Y shaped network in the middle.


# Future Perspectives

The experiments and theory discussed in this thesis have focused on the active viscoelasticity of the tissues and generating folds with using buckling instability. However, the experimental setup is foundational to many different projects in our research group. 

For instance, we only probed the shorter timescales (<10 - 30 min) and only focused on actin cytoskeleton. However, the role of other cytoskeletal components such as intermediate filament would be of great interest. As in past, it is shown that intermediate filaments play a crucial role in re-stiffening of tissue. My colleague, Tom Golde, is using MOLI to understand intermediate filament networks.

Other direction, is utilizing MOLI device for variety of different tissues from stem-cell tissues to organoids. This could allow for studying the interplay of geometry, pressure, and cell fate. Also, the inverted cell culture allows for high resolution imaging.

For mechanobiology community, this setup is particularly interesting because in the domes, when stretched for more than 100%, the nucleus gets squished which would lead to various different mechanotransduction pathways. We could easily study the role of the nucleus and different mechanosensitive proteins when subjected to deformation. As well as use pharmacological treatments to alter tissue tension and understand the specific molecular pathways involved in maintaining tissue shape.

At molecular scale, we could also look at the focal adhesions while delaminating. We inadvertently have created a system which delaminates tissue from the substrate. A clever use of protein patterning and cell line with live focal adhesion markers could allow us to understand cell-substrate adhesion. In the same vein, if we performed experiments at longer timescale we could also explore the mechanics of cell-cell junctions and cellular rearrangements in response to long term stretching.

I would be remiss if I don't mention the tissue hydraulic, in this thesis, we have broadly ignored the trans-epithelial flow because it doesn't have any effect at our timescale. Recent publication has pointed out that the epithelial tissue is an active mechano-biological pump which can create its own pressure gradient at longer timescale. We could investigate the role of fluid transport under controlled pressure.

After working with this system, I see many more directions this can go. The most interesting project of all is worked on by Thomas Wilson, where we will put in the terms like shape changing, self healing, and flexible epithelia in action. Idea is to make biohybrid devices. We will start by building a microfluidic chip where channels are made of epithelial tissues, parts of the channels could be closed or open like a valve with optogenetic tools. This will allow us to fabricate novel synthetic epithelial tissue systems and understand the fundamental physical principles behind morphogenesis.

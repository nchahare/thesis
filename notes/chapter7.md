# Epithelial stretching is driven by viscoelasticity of actomyosin cortex.

# Introduction to dome mechanics

Our motivation in this thesis is two fold: first to create three dimensional epithelia with controlled pressure, and second to study the material response of the tissue to different regimes of tension. The first goal has been achieved through fabrication of monolayer inflator (MOLI) device. We are able to form epithelia domes where cells are stretched for more than 100% of area strain.

Because of the physiological functions of epithelia, tissue has to undergo deformation over a wide range of timescales and magnitudes. Same for pressure, it is recorded that the luminal pressure in blastocysts doubles over its development leading changes in cortical tension and strain. MDCK dome system is a perfect system where we get to see the interplay between cell strain, tension, pressure. Latorre et al observed wide range of the pressure throughout evolution of the dome; and cells go through range of deformation including displaying active-superelastic behavior. However, the control is applied only on the footprint of the domes. As domes are stretching or unstretching at their will quasi-statically, the tissue tension is maintained even for various strains.

We wanted to use MOLI system to actually subject tissues to range of strain and tensions. There are very few in vitro techniques which can apply tensions and strains on suspended cells. It is critical to understand that the adherent monolayers behave differently than the suspended ones. The matrix supporting the tissue plays a great mechanical role, in providing extra stiffness and also altering the cytoskeletal structure of the cells.

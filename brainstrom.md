# Brainstorming about the flow

## Introduction

1. Epithelia is important in disease and development.
2. Mechanics plays a key role in all of this. 
simple mechanics like role of forces and mechanobiology on single cells and transcription factors.
3. Emergent phenomena and collective behavior. buckling.
4. Engineering epithelia or learn by building

## Results

1. Device itself
2. Rheology and actin gel stuff
3. Buckling phenomena
4. Programmed buckling

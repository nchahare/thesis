# Brainstorming about the flow

## Introduction

1. Epithelia is important in disease and development.
2. Mechanics plays a key role in all of this. 
simple mechanics like role of forces and mechanobiology on single cells and transcription factors.
3. Actin cortex is so so important
4. Pressure and stretching is also important.
5. Emergent phenomena and collective behavior. buckling.
6. Engineering epithelia or learn by building

## Results

1. Device itself
2. Rheology and actin gel stuff
3. Buckling phenomena
4. Programmed buckling


## List of experiments

1. Fabrication of the device with different materials.
2. Optimization of the protien patterning.
3. Optimization of the cell seeding.
4. Calibration of the pressure setup.
5. Flow experiments.

6. Inflating domes at constant pressure.
7. Optimization of the rapid imaging of the domes.
8. Repeatated pressure cycles after 5min interval gives same results.
9. LAT-A, Y27 experiments to identify the role of the cortex.
10. Slow deflation with steps to identify constitutive relation.

11. Cyclic stretching at three different rates to probe the dynamic viscoelasticity.

12. Subjecting domes to the negative pressure to produce buckling.
13. Identifying deflation rates and hold periods producing buckling.

14. Developing a light sheet microscopy compatible setup for imaging domes faster.
15. Visualized buckling in light sheet microscope.
16. Used sir-actin staining to visualize cortex buckling.

17. Produced post-buckling patterns in the domes of circular footprint of different size.
18. Produced post-buckling patterns in the domes of different shaped footprint.

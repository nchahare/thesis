# Brainstorming about the flow

## Aims of the thesis

### General aim of the thesis

Study the mechanics of epithelial layers subjected to controlled pressure and tension.

### Specific aims of the thesis

General aims are divided into specific goals:

1. Review the literature on engineering epithelia, and effect of physical forces such as pressure and tension on morphogenesis.
2. Develop a new technology to control shape, size, and forces in three dimensional epithelial monolayer.
  a. Invent a microfluidic system for forming domes, blisters like epithelial structures, with aid of controlled lumen pressure and protein patterning.
  b. Verify the functioning of the device.
  c. Optimize an imaging technique to capture fast dynamics of large epithelial structures enabling its rheological characterization.
3. Study the rheology of pressurized epithelial structure.
  a. Obtain the material response of the tissue by subjecting different regimes of cyclic pressure.
  b. Analyse the stress and strain relation and understand it in context of computational framework developed in close collaboration by Adam Ouzeri.
4. Investigate the buckling phenomena

## Introduction

1. Epithelia is important in disease and development.
2. Mechanics plays a key role in all of this. Simple mechanics like role of forces and mechanobiology on single cells and transcription factors.
3. Emergent phenomena and collective behavior.
4. Pressure and stretching is also important.
5. Actin cortex is so so important.
6. Engineering epithelia or learn by building.

## Results

1. Developed a novel device to create 3D pressure controlled epithelia.
  * 1.1. Introduction to organ on chips and motivation for the device.
  * 1.2. Summary of failed and attempted methods to construct the devices.
  * 1.3. Protein patterning to create 3D epithelia.
  * 1.4. Pressure control for the device and method adopted.
  * 1.5. Optimization of the imaging large epithelial structures.

2. Actin cortex drives epithelial tissue stretching.
  * 2.1. Constitutive relation of the domes is dependent on the geometry.
  * 2.2. Computational framework developed in close collaboration by Adam Ouzeri
  * 2.3. Rheological studies show the viscoelastic nature of actin cortex in the epithelia.

3. Epithelial buckling
  * 3.1. Rapid deflation produces a buckling instability leading to form epithelial folds.
  * 3.2. Buckling occurs across different length scales to overcome compressive stresses.

4. Programmed epithelial folds
  * 4.1 Epithelial buckling lead to formation of wrinkles.
  * 4.2 Folding patterns become more complex with the increasing size.
  * 4.3 Patterns are guided by control of shape and size.
